{"article_title": ["Bridgerton has a rape scene, but it\u2019s not treated like one"], "article_body": ", Shonda Rimes\u2019s first collaboration with Netflix, may be a sumptuous, scandal-laced frolic through Regency London. But like many Shondaland series, it has plenty of dark and disturbing moments, and the show\u2019s first season leaves us with more questions than answers. Chief among them: Does the creative team realize how badly they handled the rape scene?Romance novelist Julia Quinn wrote the novel series on which  is based, starting with  in 2000. The first season, written by Shondaland veteran  (), follows  fairly closely \u2014 including one scene that\u2019s central to the plot but that has been called out repeatedly by romance readers over the years .In the two decades since the book\u2019s release,  has become more aware of what is and isn\u2019t consensual sex, and the show deliberately made changes to the scene to make it less explicitly nonconsensual. That indicates to me that Van Dusen and his fellow creatives knew the problems with the scene they were adapting. But the version of this scene that ended up in the show is still nonconsensual, despite the tweaks. And although it\u2019s framed as a serious violation of trust between consenting parties, it passes without any explicit acknowledgment on the show\u2019s part that what just occurred was a deeply disturbing violation of consent. is thematically concerned with the dynamics of informed consent, which makes it even stranger that this scene was left unaddressed; indeed, if there are any lasting repercussions for the victim of the assault or their dynamic with their rapist, we don\u2019t actually see them.Because it happens pretty quickly and the narrative moves on immediately from the specifics of the sexual encounter itself, I\u2019m not sure everyone will judge this scene in the same way I do. But that\u2019s why we should discuss it.is a historical romance set during London\u2019s Regency era, a period of whirling 19th-century ballrooms and high-society intrigues. Our story revolves around gorgeous debutante Daphne Bridgerton () and the fake courtship she arranges during her debut on London\u2019s \u201cmarriage mart,\u201d the upper-class ritual of social functions that help eligible ladies and gentlemen make a match.Despite coming from a powerful family and making a splash at her debut, Daphne is having trouble attracting suitors \u2014 so she bets (correctly) that faking a courtship with a very eligible duke will reignite the attention of other gentlemen. Her choice of bachelor: Simon, the hunky Duke of Hastings (), a Black man whose family was recently elevated to the peerage. Simon is trying to avoid matrimonial plots because he\u2019s sworn off marriage, due to his solemn vow never to father children in order to let his entire family line, title and all, die with him. It\u2019s a promise he made in order to spite his abusive late father, who emotionally abused Simon all his life and cared more about his dukedom than anything else.The relationship ruse is mutually beneficial for Daphne and Simon, as it allows him to avoid seriously participating in the marriage mart. But of course, in between bickering and pretending to be in love, the two fake lovebirds soon develop a very real romance. Through an unlucky turn of events involving epic misunderstandings, secret love trysts, and a duel \u2014 y\u2019know, the usual \u2014 the storyline scoots Daphne and Simon into a hastily arranged marriage. This leads to lots and lots of sex scenes because they\u2019re a hot couple who are hot for each other. But their newfound love also creates a whole new set of problems arising from Simon\u2019s vow never to sire a family \u2014 a vow Daphne knows nothing about.This subplot contributes to \u2019s most interesting thematic idea, if one it ultimately squanders: the relationship between scandal, secrets, and informed consent. The plot revolves around Simon\u2019s choice not to tell Daphne that he has vowed not to have children. Instead, he only tells her that he \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d have children, a clear difference from \u201cwon\u2019t.\u201d This deception places her in a doubly vulnerable position: Daphne\u2019s in the dark about sex generally, as a woman who\u2019s had no sexual education, and since she\u2019s getting most of her tutelage from him directly, she has no way of knowing that he\u2019s hiding things from her about his sexual health and practices. Simon\u2019s duplicity is, to some extent, unwitting \u2014 he doesn\u2019t intend to trap Daphne into marriage, but when events conspire to make marriage a necessity, he goes along with it, spinning a story that implies his inability to father children rather than tell her the truth. The narrative treats the difference between \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d and \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d as a crucial distinction, one that fills Daphne with horror and bitterness when she realizes it. It\u2019s an interesting turn because  frames Simon\u2019s deceptive phrasing as deliberate, along with his choice to continue lying to her by omission. This deception placed Daphne in the position of being unable to give informed consent, either to sex or to their entire relationship.The problem is that she only figures this out by raping him.Let me back up. Daphne knows nothing about sex when she gets married. Her mother, too embarrassed to give her the specifics, sends her off to her marriage bed completely unprepared. Meanwhile, instead of telling his new wife what\u2019s up, Simon enjoys ravenous sex with Daphnebut adopts the ol\u2019 tried-and-true contraceptive method of pulling out every time. Eventually, Daphne figures out that there\u2019s some connection between Simon never completing the act and his insistence that he can\u2019t have children. Determined to figure out whether he\u2019s capable of it, she takes control during sex and positions herself on top of him so he can\u2019t pull out.When he realizes his predicament right before orgasm, Simon looks alarmed and tries to stop \u2014 he cries out twice for Daphne to wait \u2014 but it\u2019s too late. Once she\u2019s achieved her goal, she stops, and he processes what just happened in shock.The strangest thing about this moment is that I\u2019m not sure the show\u2019s writers considerthis scene to be a rape scene. Daphne is immediately furious with Simon for lying to her, and the show then focuses on her betrayal and rage; she even has a semantic speech about the difference between \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d and \u201ccan\u2019t.\u201d It\u2019s clearly intended to spell out the intricacies of informed consent, but none of Simon\u2019s duplicity justifies the way Daphne pulls his secret \u2014and, to be clear, his semen \u2014 out of him. One bad moment of uninformed consent does not justify a moment of nonconsensual sex. And depriving Simon of his consent to both sex and fatherhood, even at the moment of climax, is still rape.If the show had really explored the idea that Simon\u2019s lie led to another similar violation of  consent, that could have resulted in some really interesting narrative choices involving the two of them dealing with the fallout of both their betrayals and learning to communicate more clearly and carefully and sensitively. But the show doesn\u2019t dwell on Daphne\u2019s choices, or on any long-term aftermath from that moment. The incident doesn\u2019t seem to impact Simon\u2019s ability to trust Daphne in bed. Instead, the show turns toward Daphne\u2019s distrust of him for lying to her, dwelling on Simon\u2019s need to win her forgiveness and give up his vow for the sake of their happiness.I should note here that an  of this scene also occurs in the novel. Quinn clearly wrote the scenario as a violation: \u201cDaphne had aroused him in his sleep, taken advantage of him while he was still slightly intoxicated, and held him to her while he poured his seed into her.\u201dSince the book was written, countless romance writers and readers have inserted   on  of rape (and tropes of dubious consent like \u201cforced seduction\u201d) in romance fiction. But according to Quinn herself in a  with romance vlogger , the consent issues in that scene flew under the radar at the time  was published.\u201cYes, it was shocking, but no one seemed to feel that Daphne had done anything morally wrong,\u201d she told BooksandKrys. \u201cIt was only as years passed and we gained new understanding of \u2018consent\u2019 that people started to question her actions.\u201d Quinn offered some perspective on the dynamics of rape as early as 2003; speaking then to , she , \u201cI can\u2019t imagine a romance novel published today where the hero rapes the heroine and she falls in love with him ... I can\u2019t think of anything in my books that any feminist would find objectionable. ... And I consider myself a feminist.\u201dYet by 2010, the scene was being   readers as an example of sexual assault and lack of consent. By 2015, readers were  to point out its disturbing dynamics. That the show\u2019s creatives included this scene while making it less broadly, but still explicitly, nonconsensual, suggests they knew it needed fixing. But it seems like they failed to see how badly they ultimately handled it. Without signaling more effectively that Daphne\u2019s choice was just as violating for Simon as his secrecy was for Daphne,  undermines its entire experiment in exploring the boundaries of consent.Through this moment, the show also undermines its central relationship, causing us to question the whole foundation of Daphne and Simon\u2019s affection for each other. Because  doesn\u2019t make an effort to depict Daphne\u2019s rape of Simon as a huge issue that must be addressed for them to heal their marriage, we don\u2019t really have much way of understanding whether their mutual trust is really fully repaired in the end. And we\u2019re given no assurance that she won\u2019t violate his trust the next time she decides he might be lying to her.It\u2019s also frankly a giant gaslight; even as I write this, I\u2019m wondering if maybe I\u2019m wrong and that the scene  rape \u2014 or if, perhaps, maybe this is the one time in history where somebody gets raped and it\u2019s just not that big a deal, so it\u2019s just kinda okay that the show glosses over it and moves on and Simon seems totally fine afterward. Obviously, these are horrible takeaways for a show to leave us with. The dynamics of consent are complex and often frustrating and confusing, but one thing is almost universally certain: Rape is a big deal, and it often hugely impacts and alters both the rape survivor and the rapist. For  to ineffectively convey that Daphne raped Simon and then treat it like it was a minor side note to the much bigger issue of him lying to her makes it more difficult for audiences watching it to understand what consent looks like. The fact that the rape victim here is both male and a person of color makes it even more egregious that the show is glossing over the incident. Men are often considered  of sexual assault, and Black men in particular are often  for sexual violence, which further erases the status of Black male victims of sexual assault. In this context, the show\u2019s emphasis on Simon as the instigator of Daphne\u2019s choice basically paints him as being responsible for his own rape. This aligns with the broader cultural gaslighting of Black men and the shifting of blame away from the white men and women who enact violence upon them.Bridgerton has drawn its fair share of rave reviews as, among other things, \u201c.\u201d As a huge, lifelong lover of the sorts of romance stories  is adapting, what I hate most about this summation is that it implies that the ingredients of this story are a part of the inherent nature of the raunchy, racy historical romance. Not only is that a condescending attitude toward a genre that is frequently very literary and very serious, but it\u2019s flatly wrong: Rape, especially unacknowledged rape, is by no means a feature of historical romance writing, nor was it going unaddressed and undebated back when Quinn wrote this story 20 years ago. Countless romance writers have done better than this.  could and should have followed their example.\n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

{"article_title": ["The Lost Year: Chronic pain, an unusual love story, and reassurance via pickle"], "article_body": "Before Covid-19 hit, Honey rarely left the house. Much of their work as an artist and photographer could happen within their home, and they were used to spending a lot of time alone. Chronic physical and mental conditions made staying at home a strong preference.But that hasn\u2019t been true in the midst of the pandemic. In the past nine months, Honey has taken a job with the post office as a delivery driver and gotten married (to someone they met  the pandemic). I\u2019m fascinated by the ways so many of our worlds have shrunk over this period, but Honey\u2019s has actually expanded, to encompass both a spouse and a new job that takes them out on the road a few days a week.I\u2019m also fascinated by Honey\u2019s story of managing a chronic pain condition in the midst of a pandemic, especially when so many of their symptoms present similarly to Covid-19 symptoms. Their solution for making sure they\u2019re \u201cjust\u201d suffering from chronic pain and not the virus is clever. Throughout our chat, I was blown away by Honey\u2019s observations on a world in isolation, a world that resembles the one they\u2019ve lived in for most of their life.Here\u2019s Honey\u2019s story, as told to me.Before the pandemic, I did a lot of film photography. I was creating all the time. Now, I shifted gears and got into other formats. I\u2019ve been doing a lot of collage work. I\u2019ve been doing sewing and embroidery and stuff. Some people have hired me to do paid photo shoots, and I always tell them I\u2019m going to wear a mask and shoot with my close lens, so I can be far away from them. But I do them. Money\u2019s money.Honestly, changing art forms has been really good for me. I don\u2019t think I would have done it [if not for the pandemic]. I wouldn\u2019t have been able to discover all the things that I can do. My quarantine experience probably hasn\u2019t been like other people\u2019s. Before the pandemic, I didn\u2019t go to parties or anything, and I just left [the house] for things like grocery shopping. I have some mental health conditions, like autism, ADHD, and PTSD, but I also have physical health struggles, like endometriosis and arthritis. Those are definitely a challenge. If anything, there are certain ways \u2014 and maybe it\u2019s not cool to say this \u2014 in which quarantine has been helpful. When I used to tell people, \u201cOh, I can\u2019t hang out,\u201d it was much harder to get them to understand why. And now it\u2019s like, \u201cOh, there\u2019s a pandemic. I can\u2019t come.\u201d And a lot of jobs beforehand were not at all accommodating, or they didn\u2019t have a lot of infrastructure for that. And now if I say that I\u2019m sick and I can\u2019t come in, they\u2019ll say, \u201cOh, my gosh, stay home!\u201d I even got a job as a delivery driver with the post office. So it\u2019s interesting \u2014 I\u2019m definitely leaving my house more [than I did before the pandemic], but I\u2019m leaving my house to be alone in a car by myself, which is the ideal situation. I live in South Carolina, and in the upstate area [where I live], we shut down for maybe two weeks max. It was so quiet and weird. And a lot of people were home when I would deliver, which I wouldn\u2019t like. But what was  weird was that very shortly after that, everything was back to normal. Everybody was out, like the pandemic didn\u2019t exist. No one was wearing masks. The times when I\u2019m in the building, loading my packages in my truck, I have my mask on. Some of my coworkers do, but most of them absolutely do not wear their masks. And it\u2019s so stressful to me. I want to say something. I\u2019m scared to say something. I think many white people will always see inconvenience as oppression. And it\u2019s not even that much of an inconvenience! They just hate that they have to do what everybody else is doing. They have this obsession with hyper-individualization that carries through not only to wearing a mask like everybody else; hyper-individualization in America also means that you\u2019re responsible for your own health. It\u2019s your fault if you get sick. It\u2019s not my fault for not wearing a mask. You got sick, and that\u2019s on you.I grew up in a very isolated setting, and that prepared me for a lot [of this experience]. My parents had seven kids, and we pretty much didn\u2019t interact with anyone outside our family. It was complete lockdown. I couldn\u2019t watch TV or read unapproved books. So most of the relationships I formed in my life, I\u2019ve formed over the internet. I feel like this pandemic has been less challenging for people who grew up in specifically traumatizing households and people who have certain mental illnesses. For us, it\u2019s often normal to conduct all our relationships over the internet. And some neurotypical people and people who love going out to meet people are having a lot of trouble adjusting.I\u2019m living with my wife now, and I\u2019ve been semi on my own since I was 17, but I never had my own space. And now I have my own space. I get to control the experiences I have. I\u2019m just starting with movies and TV and books. There\u2019s no end to the entertainment and the new things I can discover. I just watched an anime called . It\u2019s really gay, and it\u2019s awesome.I met my wife at the start of the pandemic, on Tinder. I met them at the perfect time. I was learning a lot of important things on how to be independent, and they, as a person, are extremely independent. We\u2019re around each other, because we enjoy each other\u2019s company, but whenever we need our own space, we just take our own space. There\u2019s a mutual understanding and a flow to it. It helped to almost approach the marriage like a business arrangement and not put pressure and stress on it and see where things went. It progressed very naturally, and it\u2019s easy to be in a relationship with them.Neither of us really believes in marriage, but they are ex-military, and they have health benefits and a retirement fund. I really needed surgery at the time, and it worked out, because we like each other. We met, and we saw each other every day since the first time we met up, and then we got married. It\u2019s been good. It\u2019s been pretty easy. We\u2019ve made sure to take precautions. If we mutually agree that we don\u2019t want to be together in a romantic or sexual way, we have everything planned out for that. We\u2019re not stupid. The pandemic has exacerbated certain struggles we have. But because we have different things to manage, there is a balance. I\u2019m able to be there for them, and they\u2019re able to be there for me. The issues that affect me the most right now are my physical issues, and they are affected by their mental issues. So they\u2019re able to help me with physical things, and I can help them with mental things.Everything that I deal with \u2014 chronic pain, nausea, having trouble moving \u2014 mimics the symptoms of Covid-19. And every couple of weeks, I\u2019ll have a freakout and be like, \u201cOh, my god, what if I have it.\u201d But the one symptom I don\u2019t get with my chronic illnesses is a loss of taste or smell. So if I\u2019m experiencing symptoms, I can easily spiral. \u201cWhat if the hospital is full? What if the bill is so expensive we can\u2019t pay it?\u201d Just freaking out. So now whenever I start freaking out, I just go eat a pickle or something to calm myself down and reassure myself. But it took me a lot of months to get there!One of the biggest struggles has been that both of us are learning we don\u2019t have to hide things from each other. It\u2019s difficult, because we both grew up in environments where we had to hide things, just from us being queer and growing up in very homophobic families. At the beginning, it almost helped with the honesty [between us] being thrust immediately into a situation where we can take our own space if we want, but because of the pandemic, we are like, \u201cOkay, you\u2019re the only person that I\u2019m going to see now.\u201d Knowing we have [a plan] but also being stuck in a house together helps with two things. First, [we have that plan], so I don\u2019t have to be afraid to bring things up to my partner. And second, we are kind of stuck here, so to speak, so me keeping things to myself is stupid and childish. It\u2019s just better to talk it out.\n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

{"article_title": ["The year in things"], "article_body": "This year has deeply changed us \u2014 all at once, things were no longer as they were. That was followed by the slowly dawning realization that the unfathomable was here to stay. The country was rattled; we became situated in the kind of chaos that hadn\u2019t even ever occurred to us as a possibility.We don\u2019t quite have our footing yet; we\u2019re still gathering our bearings. When you\u2019re thrown for a loop this large, it is hard not to be angry and irritable and, as the circumstances demanded of us, lonely. We\u2019re still looking for explanations: why us, why now, why like this \u2014 the world was so relentlessly disorienting every single day. We\u2019ve , but we don\u2019t know everything yet.Somehow, we cobbled our way through. Just as our lives and our selves changed, the stuff around us seemed to change, too. Things that were once important \u2014 like work clothes and plane tickets \u2014 became virtually obsolete, while mundane stuff like mail and yeast became incredibly valuable and precious. The fear of scarcity and supply chain disruptions sent us spiraling in the grocery store. The essentials, like masks and toilet paper, ruled our lives. At home, many of us let off steam by shopping online. Our simple impulses revealed what we were really in need of: new ways to move, live, and survive. We had to fill the incredibly slow and fast passing of time with what we could control. A year in review feels like a bleak undertaking, so we\u2019ve chosen instead to dissect the objects that defined 2020 and reflect on what they say about us. What\u2019s clear in this strange time capsule is that we were enamored of the ordinary. The small joys of this year stitched together make a bizarre image, but I think in all of this we did find a way to be happy, too.The fear that one day we were not going to be able to wipe upended our grocery store experiences. I remember, in the First Days, standing in a big-box store line that stretched and snaked around the parking lot. Someone would dash to the front, where people were leaving, and ask desperately, \u201cIs there toilet paper inside?\u201d But the fleeing customers would disappoint us every time \u2014 no, there was no toilet paper or paper towels or bleach or hand sanitizer or anything else we needed. It was anxiety-inducing every single time. It felt like nothing was ever going to be secure again. It is very American to panic at the first sign of scarcity. I found myself angry \u2014 angry! \u2014 when my local Costco put a restriction on how many frozen chickens we could buy. One didn\u2019t feel like enough. When the world ended, I wanted to go out with at least two frozen chickens. Nothing served as better shorthand for the disarming and seemingly random plight of not being able to have what we wanted when we wanted it than toilet paper. As Terry Nguyen  for Vox, Americans make up 4 percent of the world\u2019s population yet account for 20 percent of the world\u2019s toilet paper consumption. The pandemic disrupted the usual speed of our supply chains, and manufacturers had to scramble to keep up. Although the product has little to do with coronavirus symptoms, on April 12, 2020,  in the United States were out of toilet paper. Production and shipping delays, plus record-high demand and , made what was once a simple household necessity feel precious. My family tried to ration our toilet paper use \u2014 three squares per sit-down, max, which is so funny in retrospect. We should never take those little luxuries for granted again.In the spring of 2020, when we were perhaps at our most fearful, many Americans found refuge in the Nintendo Switch. The gaming system was released back in 2017, but its popularity skyrocketed when people found themselves trapped at home with nothing to do. Everyone wanted to get their hands on one, so naturally, the console began to sell out everywhere. Some people tried to sell Switches for high markups, hoping to turn a profit and capitalize on everyone\u2019s desperation. Sales went up by 63 percent in March 2020, according to the , which tracks video game industry data. The system\u2019s year-to-date sales are only second to the 2008 year-to-date sales of the Nintendo Wii, a console that has been made obsolete but ruled the early aughts.On March 20, Animal Crossing: New Horizons came out. It was ridiculously perfect timing. The video game series had a cult following in the past, but the pandemic gave it a particular edge. The plushy world of Animal Crossing allows players to  of the pandemic and focus on cuter concerns, like how much fake currency it would take to buy a virtual home decoration. Building an island paradise of happy animals (however indebted users may be to a raccoon real estate tycoon, Tom Nook) was a welcome distraction to the isolation and confusion of our new reality. Boredom is no good when the world is also falling apart. Animal Crossing and the Nintendo Switch offer an alternative to wallowing: the ability to immerse yourself in a world where suffering does not exist. Right now, many  the Sony Playstation 5 and the Microsoft Xbox Series X. The console mania isn\u2019t stopping anytime soon, and as long as we\u2019re trapped indoors, we\u2019ll need a virtual escape.Overnight, the supermarket became a scary place, so we became bakers. Making your own sourdough at home made things a little bit easier; the bread aisle was likely ransacked anyway, and flour and yeast can keep for a long time. Like toilet paper, 2020 also saw flour and yeast shortages, making them like powdered gold. Rob MacKie, the president and CEO of the American Bakers Association,  that the pandemic blindsided the industry because demand typically coincides with the holiday season. Our sudden interest in baking appeared about eight months ahead of schedule and at a higher volume than ever.People traded  for no-knead bread, for banana bread, for pizza dough. It was a communal experiment in taking care of ourselves and each other. A warm piece of bread is even more comforting when you\u2019ve made it yourself. That feeling was something we could share.Plus, many people had time to wait for dough to rise. We worked from home, or maybe we\u2019d been laid off or were taking care of a loved one or were waiting for an essential worker to get home from a shift. Emily VanDerWerff put it best : \u201cBread baking is a thing we do in a crisis, perhaps because bread is one of the very foundations of human civilization. ... The world is scary and uncertain. Bread is just science. Or it\u2019s magic. Or it\u2019s both.\u201dIt\u2019s strange to think about how in the first few weeks of the pandemic, we weren\u2019t even wearing masks. They\u2019ve become such a familiar sight, but once upon a time, they were even , which was hoping to save scarce personal protective equipment for essential workers. But as mask production ramped up and the curve failed to flatten, mask mandates because vital and common. , for example, only kicked in on June 18.Our grandkids are going to ask us about masks, if climate change doesn\u2019t get us first, and we\u2019ll have to tell them we spent a lot of time fighting about them. Many Americans feel that mask mandates  and don\u2019t see them as a kind of . According to a 130,000 lives could potentially be saved by February 2021 if mask usage were universal. This object isn\u2019t as sentimental as others that defined 2020. They were a necessity \u2014 quite literally the difference between life and death. People , donated them to health care workers, . Other people  on the panic and hoarded masks in order to then sell them for a fat profit. N95 respirator masks, which provide a closer fit and more filtration, were key for health care workers but were also in short supply. Nothing was more emblematic of 2020 than the mask, which helped us through but also showed us what was broken in the country. Matters of public safety, like refraining from , became debates about freedom, and our most vulnerable and essential Americans were the least protected.According to a , adults over age 30 increased their alcohol consumption by 14 percent during the pandemic. It seemed like the obvious thing to do, when thousands of people were dying every day and the sirens blared on and the news told us we were vulnerable, failing, and probably hopeless. Restaurants and bars were failing, too. The decline began around March 15, when governments in many major cities closed down for the pandemic.In , Gov. Cuomo decided one way to bail out restaurants was through an executive order that allowed the sale of to-go alcohol. This was unprecedented. It has long been illegal to have open containers of alcohol on the street, a rule that feels prudish and outdated but has prevailed. The thrill of a to-go beer was a small novelty, like suddenly living in a different city, and the morale booster we needed. Plenty of restaurants , but those that are still standing continue to offer to-go alcohol, now with state-mandated snacks. In a state like , for example, getting alcoholic drinks to go might not be a new thing, but in New York, it was a game changer. It was just one of many rare freedoms this year gave us, like not wearing a bra all the time; tiny joys to get us through. As Jaya Saxena argued , hopefully this 2020 mainstay continues into the new year.The pandemic put the United States Postal Service at risk. As Adam Clark Estes reported , the whole thing was a mess due to a variety of factors: policy changes headed by Postmaster Louis DeJoy and President Trump, a need for government funding, an increase in mail, and political debates about the legitimacy of mail-in ballots. As a reaction, people bought stamps (and ) to support the USPS and  to pen pals. The latter was the result of quarantine boredom. So many of us had been separated from each other for so long, and writing a big, fat \u201cI miss you, what\u2019s up\u201d letter feels more purposeful than shooting out a dry text. It\u2019s also a good way to mark the time. Endless days and weeks are a little more tangible when letter-writing documents the mundane details of it all. In school growing up, teachers always talked about how historical artifacts taught us about what went on way back when. Letters always fell into this category, and although there\u2019s much that is preserved in the digital world, it\u2019s cool to think about someone decades from now reading old letters that collected the unique sufferings and pleasures of this strange time.At the beginning of June 2020, New York City received 1,737 complaints about fireworks, a staggering 80 times more than the previous year, according to the . All across the country, people also observed an  in places like Milwaukee, Boston, and San Francisco. Since this occurred directly after nationwide protests concerning  and police brutality, and well before July Fourth, some entertained the idea that the fireworks might be a plot to disorient activists and Black communities. This conspiracy theory was never proven, but the explosions rattled many in an especially fraught time. As Matthew Yglesias , it\u2019s hard to know the source of the fireworks \u2014 was it actually more noise than usual, or did it just feel that way? It may have been easier to hear the booms with fewer people out and about, or the lack of July Fourth activities could have created a surplus of fireworks that got sold to people who said, \u201cHey, why not?\u201d Fireworks are undeniably fun, especially when so many people were bored with nothing else to do. They were gone as quickly as they appeared. I\u2019m not sure when the fireworks disappeared in my neighborhood, but they never occurred to me again until I started writing this story. What even wasthat?Hundreds are protesting outside Gracie Mansion in  right now after  refuses to do anything about the insane fireworks the last few weeks plaguing NYC. Residents can't sleep, so they decided to not allow Deblasio to sleep tonight either. It was a year of protests: BLM, anti-lockdown sentiment, and even demands from those who desperately wanted the fireworks to stop. On June 23, protesters blared their car horns outside Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s home to urge him to take action on the fireworks use. It was a sleepless, paranoid year of irritability. After a spring spent mostly inside, summer demanded that we get outside. Except there wasn\u2019t always a place to go. For those of us without big backyards or easy access to local parks and beaches, it was difficult to figure out how to get much-needed outdoor time while staying safe. Of the 3,000 homeowners who responded to a Home Improvement Research Institute , 8.4 percent said they planned to work on their pools or hot tubs in anticipation of the summer, but not all of us have the luxury of a backyard pool. Public pools weren\u2019t an option, either, but the kiddie pool was a solution to that. It gave us a cheap, easy way to cool off and get outside after months cooped up.In-ground pools, by comparison, are bourgeois. A kiddie pool says: I am a person of the people, a person who is in quarantine and desperate for an oasis. I impulsively bought one for my dog, a toy poodle who was mostly unappreciative of it, but the novelty the whole endeavor provided my family was worth it. There\u2019s something unavoidably joyous about a plastic pool. Its flimsy, fun simplicity looks a lot like this year did, which is that a kiddie pool is a matter of circumstance and deluded \u201cnecessity.\u201d We had to be indoors, and by extension, we had to pour ourselves into strange purchases and fixations. The ability to turn off our brains this year was a luxury all on its own. The barrage of bad news, the sickness of this year and its stressors were innumerable. As Kristen Arnett put it fondly , \u201cThe pool was a momentary womb. A place to float free. The pool was important because of how my body fit inside it and how it fit around me. The pool was a place where I could think, but most importantly, it became a place where I didn\u2019t have to think at all. I could just \u2026 exist.\u201d The stir-crazy energy of quarantine encouraged lots of people to start exercising at home. TikTok convinced me to subscribe to the cult of Chloe Ting, a fitness instructor whose YouTube workout programs had rave reviews, but those who were interested in a bigger fitness investment may have purchased a Peloton exercise bike, which in its cheapest package option is $1,895 plus a $39 monthly membership fee. A year ago this week we all laughed at her. What did she know and when? Many gyms and fitness studios across the country closed (and opened and closed again) over the course of 2020. They\u2019re uniquely complicated Covid-19 hot spots \u2014 basically petri dishes. As Alex Abad-Santos wrote for , \u201ceverything that makes group fitness and gyms great is exactly what makes working out with other people one of the riskiest things we can do.\u201dWe\u2019re finding that simulated group experiences aren\u2019t half bad, and in fact feel like more casual entry points to fitness. And the world seems to be all-in on Peloton, which launched in 2012. A share of the company\u2019s stock  was around $35 at the start of December 2019 and is around $115 as of this writing. This past decade was so focused on fitness as a public, moral undertaking, as proven by the  and the countless group exercise startups and boutiques that are now empty. Peloton allows us the opportunity to sweat like no one\u2019s watching.Countless people became amateur interior designers in isolation. Suddenly, Home Depot looked like an oasis, and its sales have  in the last year. The pandemic allowed us time and space to reconsider our decor and embark on small adventures in DIY projects. Enter peel-and-stick wallpaper, an easy solution to the lack of visual stimulation in your quarantine home. If we were going to stare at the walls all day, they might as well look good. As Rebecca Jennings reported , online searches for wallpaper shot up at the end of March when people began to get stir crazy. Peel-and-stick wallpaper also worked for renters cooped up in apartments, without permanently altering the space.We didn\u2019t stop there, though. TikTok was a daily showcase of quarantine DIY projects \u2014 tables and glassware and bedroom design and bathroom organizing and anything else you could think of to make your life more aesthetically pleasing. Making something yourself for your home is a source of pride, a morale booster when we needed it most. You can call it the  (the theory that consumers are likely to be satisfied with products that they assemble themselves), but there was something special about trading DIY tips with friends and family. It gives us a sense of control in an uncontrollable situation.The objects that got us through were the psychic desires of a nation battered by ourselves and by our blind spots. This year, all we had was what we could control, what we could share, and what we could hold on to.  We tried to be good neighbors, tried to distract ourselves, tried to keep our lives feeling safe in the ways that we could. These objects brought us together in weird ways, and for all our selfishness, 2020 has been a year of waiting, together, for something better on the other side. The only thing we wanted to believe in more than these objects was a better 2021. We tirelessly repeated to ourselves, \u201cWhen this is all over,\u201d a mantra we couldn\u2019t shake because we had to believe in an end. We\u2019re different now, and we might return to the mundane sometime soon, however unknowable \u201call over\u201d is. Either way, it would do us all good to remember that we survived this and that we should be grateful we got to see it through \u2014 and that we\u2019ll never look at toilet paper quite the same way again.Get our newsletter in your inbox twice a week.\n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

{"article_title": ["The history of Jews, Chinese food, and Christmas, explained by a rabbi"], "article_body": "For over a century, American Jews have eaten American Chinese food on Christmas. The annual feast is a holiday tradition that is likely to go on as usual this year, even in the midst of COVID-19 \u2014 albeit in the form of delivery or takeout.This pastime has evolved to a near-holy tradition,  on ,  in academic papers, and  by Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan.     Perhaps the foremost expert on the practice is Rabbi Joshua Eli Plaut, PhD, executive director of American Friends of Rabin Medical Center, rabbi of Metropolitan Synagogue in New York, and author of , the premier (and only?) comprehensive study of what Jews do at Christmastime.I spoke to Plaut about Chinese food on Christmas, and why he used to sit on Santa Claus\u2019s lap.   It has been a question for as long as Christmas has existed, because Jews have always felt like outsiders. But how they felt specifically was really a function of their status in society. In Eastern Europe, for instance, Jews were not very assimilated. Christmas was a night of possible pogroms and violence, with so many celebrants, often drunk, going from house to house. Jews did not go to the synagogue to study. They stayed at home for physical safety reasons. If they did anything, they might play cards or chess. In Western Europe, after the French Revolution, Jews were more assimilated. There, they had more freedom to wonder, \u201cDo I bring a Christmas tree into my home? Do I have a holiday meal? Do I give out gifts?\u201d The early Zionist Theodor Herzl was a secular Jew, and he had a Christmas tree in his salon. After the Chief Rabbi of Vienna came to visit, he  like, \u201dI hope the Rabbi doesn\u2019t think less of me because of this. Then again, what do I care what he thinks?\u201d   Yes. It begins at the end of the 19th century, on the Lower East Side, where Jewish and Chinese immigrants lived in close proximity. The very first mention of American Jews eating in a Chinese restaurant dates to 1899, when the American Hebrewjournal criticized Jews for eating at non-kosher restaurants. By 1936, a publication called the East Side Chamber News reported at least 18 Chinese tea gardens and chop suey eateries in heavily-populated Jewish neighborhoods. All of these were within close walking distance of Ratner\u2019s, which was then the most famous Jewish dairy restaurant in Manhattan.Jews would go out for Chinese food on Sundays, when they felt left out of church lunch. It was a gradual transition from the traditional diet of Eastern Europe, to eating American Chinese food, to eating other pan-Asian cuisines, like Indian food. I like to say that, within a hundred years of arriving in New York, the average Jew was more familiar with sushi than gefilte fish. In the last 35 years, Chinese restaurants on Christmas have really become this sort of temporary community where Jews in the United States can gather to be with friends and family. It\u2019s a secular way to celebrate Christmas, but it\u2019s also a time to shut out Christmas and announce your Jewish identity in a safe environment.In terms of kosher law, a Chinese restaurant is a lot safer than an Italian restaurant. In Italian food, there is mixing of meat and dairy. A Chinese restaurant doesn\u2019t mix meat and dairy, because Chinese cooking is virtually dairy-free. In Chinese-American cooking, if there is any pork [which is not a kosher food], it is usually concealed inside something, like a wonton. A lot of Jews back then \u2014 and even now \u2014 kept strict kosher inside the home but were more flexible with foods they ate at restaurants. Sociologist Gaye Tuchman . She described [the plausible deniability of non-kosher ingredients] as [ is the Yiddish word for non-kosher.] A lot of Jews considered the pork in Chinese food to be , because they couldn\u2019t see it. That made it easier to eat.  I actually found a citation from 1935, in the New York Times, about a restaurant owner named Eng Shee Chuck who brought chow mein to the Jewish Children\u2019s Home on Christmas Day. If you were to interview Chinese restaurant owners, they\u2019d tell you that Christmas is their biggest day of the year, outside of probably the Chinese New Year. If you want a more thorough understanding, though, you should probably go talk to some restaurant owners in Chinatown.     When Jews began to settle on the Lower East Side of Manhattan between the 1880s and the 1920s, they were poor immigrants. They worked in sweatshops and lived in tenement housing. In their time off, they would go to the newly opened . For between one cent and five cents, they could see a very early form of a movie. By 1909, there were 42 nickelodeons adjacent to the Lower East Side and 10 uptown in Jewish Harlem. Christmas was just another day off, so these early movies attracted big crowds.We know from the Yiddish press that Christmas became a popular day for the opening of new Yiddish theater productions. It was a day off from work, so what do you do? You can stay home, or you can go to the nickelodeons, or the Yiddish theater. Eventually, decades later, you could go have a meal in a Chinese restaurant. For many years I was researching this book. This year, I\u2019ll be with my family in a small town, where there are no real restaurants open. We will probably play a board game or watch Netflix.   I never went to Chinese restaurants. We\u2019d go skating in front of the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree, and then we\u2019d have hot chocolate with marshmallows. I have great memories of Christmas. My mother would take me to sit on Santa Claus\u2019s lap. When I was writing this book, I asked her, \u201cWhy did you take me \u2014 the son of a rabbi! \u2014 to sit on Santa Claus\u2019s lap?\u201d She said, \u201cEverybody in America does it, so why shouldn\u2019t we?\u201d She knew I was secure in my Jewish identity.\n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

{"article_title": ["Here are the 9 most interesting conversations I had in 2020"], "article_body": "My job at Vox is to talk to interesting people. And in 2020, I got to talk to a lot of really, really interesting people.Nine conversations in particular stick out to me. They were the ones that challenged me the most, got me thinking in a new way about a difficult problem, or simply explained what the hell was happening in this disorienting year.There\u2019s no unifying thread tying all these conversations together, but each of them, in its own way, left a strong impression on me. One of my favorites was with , who talked about how to find meaning in the middle of all this suffering and why our culture struggles with questions of deep existential significance.My interview with professor  about the  released by the Pentagon earlier this year managed to be both fun and a genuinely provocative discussion about the possibilities of aliens visiting our planet. I also really enjoyed talking to author  about why evangelical support for Donald Trump isn\u2019t nearly as paradoxical as so many people have suggested.Several conversations, like the one with  about James Baldwin\u2019s legacy, grappled with the social and political crises we faced this year, and hopefully offered something uplifting and constructive.Whether you\u2019re interested in religion or politics or aliens, there\u2019s something in these conversations for you. So without further ado, here are the nine most interesting conversations I had this year.\u201cI think the other side wants us to think there are no swing voters, that we\u2019re doomed and it doesn\u2019t even matter if you have a message because you can\u2019t reach anyone. I think that\u2019s bullshit. I think that\u2019s a wholly incorrect view of American politics. But look, if no one\u2019s persuadable, then let\u2019s just have the revolution. Falling into despair won\u2019t help anyone, though. I mean, you can curse the darkness or you can light a candle. I\u2019m getting a fucking welding torch. Okay?\u201d \u2014James Carville\u201cIt\u2019s not the \u2018attention\u2019 we find in human resource offices, or in banks, or in department stores, where people are pretending to listen to you but all the while thinking about how they need to respond or what they already have decided they\u2019re going to say in response. What Camus means is what another French philosopher, Simone Weil, called \u2018decreation,\u2019 which is undoing yourself in order to make room for other selves in your life. And this is what Camus\u2019s characters in  understand. This is what motivates Rieux and Tarrou \u2014 they attend to their patients, to the sick, in ways that are wholly admirable.\u201d \u2014Robert Zaretsky\u201cBaldwin\u2019s revolutionary inversion is to flip the white man\u2019s burden. The white man\u2019s burden becomes the Black man\u2019s burden. That\u2019s when he says, \u2018I\u2019m not the N-word. Never have been.\u2019 The question is, why did you need to invent the N-word? Once you understand why, then maybe we can get off this damn hamster wheel. He didn\u2019t say it that way, but you get what I mean. The point is that, \u2018I\u2019m not the N-word. You invented the N-word. We need to figure out why you invented the N-word. Until we do that, I\u2019m going to give that N-word back to you. You must be the N-word.\u2019 That\u2019s the revolutionary move.\u201d \u2014Eddie Glaude Jr., author of \u201cDisasters shake us up. I\u2019ve called them a crash course in Buddhism. You\u2019re suddenly aware of ephemerality and interdependence, the fleetingness of all things, and the connection of all things. Often that connection is a deep empathic, emotional connection for their neighbors and people undergoing the same experience that people don\u2019t necessarily feel at other times. We often experience everyone around us primarily in terms of their differences rather than the commonalities. A disaster changes that in an instant.\u201d \u2014Rebecca Solnit, author of \u201cI\u2019ve thought about this, and I worry less about poking around and getting conquered and more about the potential realization that these things are here and then an internal implosion of our society. So I worry about my fellow human beings more than I worry about the aliens. So I guess in that sense, I disagree with Hawking\u2019s premise that they\u2019re out to get us. But sure, it\u2019s possible they\u2019re on a surveillance mission. But people have been reporting UFOs for at least 80 years, and that\u2019s a really, really long surveillance mission. And also, why would they want to conquer us? That\u2019s like us conquering ants.\u201d \u2014Alexander Wendt\u201cThis is what \u2018family values\u2019 evangelicalism looks like, and now it\u2019s apparent to everyone. But for evangelical dissenters, this is indeed a tragedy. And yet I think even those who are resisting, or who are calling this out and who are struggling with the direction that evangelicalism has taken, still need to reckon with the ways in which they, too, as part of this tradition, have been complicit in this ideology. The Trump era didn\u2019t just happen. We\u2019ve been moving in this direction for a long time.\u201d \u2014Kristin Kobes Du Mez, author of \u201cI think that the spiritual malaise of the society, the sense of the meaningless at the core, is partly a result of the fact that our tools, which make us so much more efficient, also serve to isolate us from one another. Then the pandemic came along and exacerbated that isolation, and people ask deep questions about what is this about and what is this for and how can life just change on a dime and how am I supposed to live in the absence of all the things that I used to take for granted and care about? In other words, we have been suddenly plunged into an existential crisis, and we\u2019re not a society in general that turns to deep questions of life meaning.\u201d \u2014Rabbi David Wolpe, author of \u201cBurnout is the feeling that you\u2019ve hit the wall exhaustion-wise, but then have to scale the wall and just keep going. There\u2019s no catharsis, no lasting rest, just this background hum of exhaustion. It manifests in not being able to make the sort of decisions you actually want to make \u2014 my classic example is that you\u2019re so tired, you just scroll Instagram instead of reading the book that you legitimately do want to read \u2014 and everything in your life flattens into one endless, ever-recyling to-do list that you just feel like you have to get through so that you can do the next thing on the list.\u201d \u2014Anne Helen Petersen, author of \u201cSuffering can be a door by which we exit our isolated ego and we enter into the suffering of another.

{"article_title": ["I was always terrified of wasting time. A cancer diagnosis made me reconsider."], "article_body": "The room didn\u2019t spin like they say it does. My life didn\u2019t flash before my eyes. I had no difficulty understanding the verdict: It was incurable.They could offer no prognosis. They had some general ideas about how they might treat me; it was considered \u201cmanageable\u201d in its normal form, but in my case, there was no telling what would or wouldn\u2019t work. They told me that if they could find an effective treatment, I should expect to be on it \u201cfor life.\u201dThe week of the 2016 election, my foot had gone numb \u2014 paralyzed, actually. I\u2019d first arrived at the neurologist\u2019s office unable to wiggle my toes, and now I was leaving with a singularly rare cancer diagnosis, a blood cancer that had jumped its track and hadn\u2019t shown up as it was supposed to. Even though my blood, lymph, and bone marrow were all clear, a blood cancer had somehow emerged in my cerebrospinal fluid and lodged itself along my spinal cord, forming hundreds of microlesions. The oncologist (who specialized in rare lymphomas) responded, \u201cGet !\u201d when the neurologist shared the results of my spinal tap. They were looking forward to meeting me. There isn\u2019t much that\u2019s good about being a unique cancer case, but at least the specialists are excited to see you.It wasn\u2019t until the drive home, as my husband, David, and I tried to figure out how and what to tell the children, that the terror overcame me. How could I prepare my middle schoolers for what we might face? There was no reassurance I could offer. Any expectation that the next day would be better or even vaguely resemble the days before had disappeared entirely.We told them the naked truth. The doctors couldn\u2019t say what might happen next because they had never seen this before. The outcome was uncertain, so hope and fear were both reasonable. Anything could happen: anything bad, anything good, or anything in between. That night, unable to sleep, a strange, intrusive thought scrolled through my head: \u201cThe future has been amputated.\u201d There would be weeks of hospitalizations, infusions, nausea, and fatigue before I could summon the presence of mind to interrogate that thought. On my first wobbly walk around the park near my home, I spotted a cute two-bedroom house on a side street.\u201cMaybe,\u201d I wondered, \u201cwe could downsize to a cute little house like that once the kids are off to college \u2026 ?\u201dI stopped myself short. That would be seven years away. My survival relied on the efficacy of a chemotherapy, fresh out of trials, designed to treat cancers of the blood. My medical team wasn\u2019t sure if it would work at all.I might not live to see my eldest graduate. Who knew if I would survive even the year?I sat down on a bench, dizzy. People hurried past me, some rushing home from work, some squeezing in a run before dinner, others racing toward schools to fetch their kids. Everywhere they were headed, it seemed, was a lot more important than where they happened to be right now.For decades, my life had been as organized as theirs. I was always ambitious, my calendar overflowing: a private psychotherapy practice, parenting, writing, martial arts, caring for elderly family members, volunteering as a community organizer. Friends and colleagues marveled at how I got so much done. Now it was clear I had been running on overdrive for years, racing toward some magical day in the future when I\u2019d have accomplished enough and might allow myself to rest.It was as if cancer had flung me into a parallel universe where I would never again spend, waste, or experience time as others did, or as I had before. Sitting on that bench watching the early winter sunset, I realized that I never had the ability to shape my future. I\u2019d been chasing an illusion. The causal chain I\u2019d been constructing was wiped away in a single stroke. The only real time was now: the sun setting, the park bench, the crisp, cold air filling my lungs.I thought of the many future-focused conversations I had daily: psychotherapy clients dreaming of one dayfinding the right partner, or the right job, or hoping to eventually leave the wrong ones. Neighbors planning their vacations. Other parents fantasizing about their children\u2019s college and career trajectories. Every weekday conversation filled with yearning for the next weekend. The systems that surround us intensify our future fantasies, like an unattainable carrot at the end of a proverbial stick, driving us all to press ourselves harder and faster toward some end that never quite comes in the way we imagine.Ambition has a necessary function: It may offer hope in times of desolation, or motivate us out of states of suffering and depletion. Yet aspirations have their shadows. Striving can imply that the present moment is inadequate. It seems as though ambition has been elevated into a distorted religion. But our relentless cultural habit of structured goal-setting and futurizing are nonsensical once we gaze into the abyss. Existentialist philosophy and therapies, Buddhist notions of impermanence, and the Christian practice of memento mori(remember your death) all assert that the process of accepting the inescapability of death can help us to live a more meaningful life.The amputation of my felt-sense of unfolding time was violent and sudden. It began with a visceral realization of how I spentmy now-limited time. If lost time could not be recouped, did I really want to spend much (or any) of it at a professional association meeting, or organizing fundraisers, or trapped on long phone conversations with a needy acquaintance?Over the next three years of treatment, I extricated myself from activities and relationships that either didn\u2019t serve or took precious time away from core priorities: being present for my family, supporting my clients, giving what I could to my community, and \u2014 always \u2014 respecting my limitations. I no longer worried about reaching arbitrary goals, building \u201cmomentum,\u201d or even growing a business. I sat with the person in front of me for the time they were in front of me. Each moment, pleasant or unpleasant, had become an end in itself, rather than a means to an end.My small family downsized our home and our lives, and we adjusted expectations in order to reduce financial pressures. I abandoned long-term writing projects and wrote only when I felt I had something to say. I gave up the belts and stages of martial arts practice and instead took long walks. My book list shifted to shorter collected readings that would offer up new ideas along the way, free of the demand to reach every last page. Eventually, I had no more attachments or plans beyond a general weekly schedule, no more fantasies of a great come-and-get-it day. The tasks were simple: to fully live the one day I\u2019d been given; to be who I meant to be in each moment, to the best of my abilities.At first, this shift in my orientation to time was alienating and lonely as everyone around me continued to think ahead. Later, I realized I didn\u2019t miss that. A large bite had been taken out of my sense of linear, causal, chronological time \u2014 the Greek notion of chronos But what I\u2019d found in its place was kairos: this particular, critical moment. The appointed time. The time of action.My unpredictable cancer unpredictably became undetectable after 30 hard months of treatment. I have been off chemotherapy for a year and a half. It is possible that I have 10, even 20, years of time and health left. Or maybe this unpredictable cancer will reemerge when I least expect it. Maybe next week I\u2019ll learn that I have a lesion on my optic nerve. No one knows, because there is no knowing.A smaller, lighter sense of future has crept back into my life, terrifying in its own way. I can now permit myself to fantasize a year ahead, or sometimes two. I\u2019ve noticed gentle new goals sneaking in: to spend a little more time teaching and a little less time counseling. I\u2019ve applied to a seminary program, aware that I may not make it to enrollment or live to finish the program.

{"article_title": ["The Lost Year: A new baby who didn\u2019t know your face for days because you were wearing a mask "], "article_body": "A handful of people I know have had babies during the pandemic, a typically joyous but stressful life event made 10 times more stressful, at least, by an accident of history. The sheer isolation of quarantine has led to many new parents essentially having to cocoon even more than usual with their newborns.But a particularly fraught story of pandemic birth comes from Jacinta, who lives in Melbourne and works in film distribution. Australia enacted incredibly stringent Covid-19 lockdowns \u2014 which seem to have mostly worked out, as the country is in the process of reopening \u2014 to the degree that the restrictions grew more strict while Jacinta was in labor.But after her son was born, Jacinta found herself in a minor nightmare, after she was discharged from the hospital and he had to stay in the NICU due to an infection. All is well now, but it led to a frantic, sleepless handful of days for Jacinta and her husband. Here\u2019s her story, as told to me.Most of the start of lockdown for us happened in March. I told people we were pregnant, but I wasn\u2019t showing or anything. Then I didn\u2019t see anyone again until about two weeks ago, when I have a four-month-old baby now. My husband and I joked it was like those 1950s pregnancies where they\u2019d send you away to live with an aunt for the summer, and you\u2019d come back with a \u201cbaby sister.\u201d A lot of people that I didn\u2019t see regularly didn\u2019t know I was pregnant, especially since we don\u2019t use social media a lot.In the lead-up to my due date, it had already been a bit of a nightmare with Covid. We hadn\u2019t yet in Melbourne entered the really hardcore level of restrictions, but they had been building for months. All the prenatal classes were canceled. All the birthing classes were canceled. Everything was moved online. The day that I went into labor, there were already rules in place about how far you could drive from your house without a permit or a valid excuse. We were really scared we were going to get pulled over by the cops on the drive to the hospital, even though, obviously, giving birth would be considered a valid excuse.About 10 minutes after I got admitted, I got handed a facemask very apologetically. The nurses said that they were really sorry but just at that minute, the policy changed about masks in the hospital, and patients had to wear them no matter what. So I had to wear a face mask for what was a 10-hour labor, which was not great. Toward the end, they took pity on me because my oxygen levels were dropping. I couldn\u2019t breathe super well in the mask when I was having contractions. So they looked the other way and said, \u201cWe\u2019ll let you take it off. Just don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d I put it straight back on again when my son got put on my chest. A new level of restrictions had come in while I was giving birth, and that meant no visitors, not just to the hospital but to your house. You were only allowed to leave the house for essentials, and there was a whole raft of things you weren\u2019t allowed to do. So we stayed in the hospital. My husband was allowed to stay during visiting hours in the day, thank God. We thought that wasn\u2019t gonna happen. But he had to leave every day and then come back. Our son had an infection. It wasn\u2019t super serious in the end, thankfully, but he had to go into the NICU for the week. So I got discharged, but he didn\u2019t. Because the hospital was under lockdown, you weren\u2019t allowed to eat food in there or use the lounge area or sit down anywhere except in a chair next to his little crib thing. So if we wanted to eat or do anything except stare at him, we had to go to the car park and hide in our car and eat there.I hadn\u2019t slept in about 80 hours by the time we found out about the infection. My husband was not able to stay over at the hospital, so I was always too scared to sleep properly because I had this little baby next to me. I was worried the infection could have been a Covid thing at first because all they wrote on his chart was \u201cinfection\u201d markers. I didn\u2019t know whether that was Covid or something more serious. The hospital was wonderful, but they were pushed to the limit. Everything had gone upside-down and topsy-turvy, so it was hard to get time with people to have a chat about what was going on. The whole thing seemed like a big, confusing fog. Maybe that was a good thing, because I was so vague and out of it that I had to put my trust in what the doctors were doing and assume it was okay.I had the mask on the whole time, so every time I was crying, it was sticking to my face. It was a mess. But the whole thing went by in a blur, and I didn\u2019t really get any clarity about what had happened until probably weeks later. I really felt the warmth of giving birth after I came home and looked back on it.From a motherhood perspective, I felt very lost at first. A lot of the things I was relying on to help me know what to do, like seeing my mother or going to birthing classes or parents\u2019 group, none of them were there. I called my mom all the time, but I really went on Reddit a lot to read advice. I spent the first month or so after he came home from hospital convinced everything that was wrong with him was a big, serious deal. And it never was. It\u2019s just because the internet makes you paranoid.My husband and I have been together since we were 18 [both are 34 now], so we\u2019ve always had each other\u2019s backs, but sometimes it would be nice to have a little more space. That sounds ungrateful, I suppose, but one thing that I didn\u2019t anticipate is that because he\u2019s home all the time, I sometimes feel like I\u2019m under more pressure to do a good job. I had it in my head that he\u2019d be home maybe for the first week or two weeks after the baby was born, and then he\u2019d go back to work, and I\u2019d be home by myself. It\u2019s wonderful that he\u2019s had all this time to spend with the baby. But what was meant to be the baby\u2019s room is now the office that he has to work from. So the baby\u2019s sleeping in our room. If the baby is crying all day or I\u2019m crying  the baby is crying, my husband is in the next room on conference calls or whatnot, and I always feel like I have to live up to some standard. If your baby\u2019s crying all day and it\u2019s just you and your baby in the house, at least you can say, \u201cWell, baby, let\u2019s you and me work it out.\u201d But having another adult in the house \u2014 not that he would ever judge me! \u2014 sometimes it\u2019s easier to just go to the park and let my son cry there. But it\u2019s honestly been wonderful to have the support. Without any other family, we\u2019ve had to become each other\u2019s everything, really. It\u2019s been difficult, and it\u2019s been rewarding, and it\u2019s been weird.I have thought about talking to my son in the future about the thing that really panicked me in the first few months of his life, when it didn\u2019t look like Covid was ever going to go away, and people used phrases like \u201cthe new normal\u201d or \u201cthe way we live will change forever.\u201d It really upset me because I hated the idea of having to explain to my son one day that we used to be able to go out and hug and kiss and shake hands.I was so wrapped up in him, and we\u2019ve been able to give him so much love and attention in a way that probably would have been a bit more diluted if we\u2019d been out and about. He\u2019s been the center. He\u2019s been the thing that\u2019s got us through all of this. There\u2019s been days and weeks that go past where we don\u2019t even really remember that Covid is happening because we\u2019re just in our house with our baby, and he\u2019s so wonderful. When he\u2019s old enough, I\u2019ll thank him for coming along when he did because otherwise, it would have been sitting around, not going out, and sadness and awfulness. I look forward to telling him that when he was born, he didn\u2019t see a human face without a mask on it for the first four weeks of his life. He got the shock of his life when he came home with us and saw we had a nose and mouth and all kinds of things. We\u2019re just now allowed out, so he\u2019s meeting his grandparents, and he\u2019s meeting friends. Our best friend had a baby not long before we did, and our babies just met each other. That was the first time my son had seen another baby. And I love just looking at his face when he sees there are other people in the world!\n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

{"article_title": ["The debate over Joe Biden canceling student debt, explained"], "article_body": "Until fairly recently,  cancellation was considered to be a fringe idea that, while popular among the  and on the left, was a mainstream nonstarter. That\u2019s begun to change. The  pandemic and  have pushed the issue even further to the forefront.  and then President  put a pause on federal student loan payments during the pandemic that expires at the end of January. But with the coronavirus crisis worse than ever, there is a growing chorus of activists, politicians, and voters calling for student debt cancellation as a form of economic stimulus. That chorus is pushing Democrats and, namely, President-elect  to go big on student debt, using federal action to wipe out some or even all of what borrowers owe.\u201cWhat\u2019s attractive about student debt cancellation in this moment is that in addition to righting a policy wrong \u2014 which is the decision to make the cost of college an individual burden when I would say it\u2019s a public good \u2014 is that it can help stimulate the economy at a moment when we need economic stimulus. And it has significant racial equity implications as well,\u201d said Suzanne Kahn, director of education, jobs, and power at the Roosevelt Institute and an advocate for complete federal student debt cancellation. It\u2019s also something Biden could try to do independently of Congress, which is attractive since stimulus talks have stalled out.Biden\u2019s campaign  the first $10,000 in federal student loan debt, but some Democrats and progressives are pushing for him to cancel more student debt through executive action \u2014 and not just $10,000, but $50,000 or even all of it. Biden  of canceling student debt unilaterally.Beyond direct cancellation, there\u2019s a lot Biden can do to make preexisting student debt programs work better and help more people. \u201cThere is a tremendous opportunity through executive action for President-elect Biden to improve the lives of millions of Americans,\u201d said Seth Frotman, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center and former student debt ombudsman at the CFPB.The conversation around student debt in the United States stretches far beyond questions of education, law, and economics. It also entails thorny discussions around racial justice, politics, and fairness. Advocates argue that debt cancellation will carry a range of benefits \u2014 stimulating the economy, promoting racial justice, and righting the wrong of pushing millions of Americans into life-hindering debt. But as the Biden administration plans its first steps, a debate is raging about whether loan forgiveness is really the best way to get the economy moving and get relief to people who need it. Some critics warn it could be a politically costly push that doesn\u2019t solve the underlying problems with higher education in the US.Broad-based student debt cancellation isn\u2019t a newidea, but it being discussed in establishment political circles is.Forty-five million Americans now owe a total of about $1.6 trillion in student loans, and  are in delinquency or default. The Federal Reserve  the typical monthly payment to be between $200 and $299. Research suggests people are delaying , having kids, and changing jobs in part because of student loan debt, which means it could become a drag on the overall economy. The burden is especially heavy on Black borrowers, who generally carry more debt and struggle more to pay it off. \u201cThis is not some niche problem,\u201d said Bharat Ramamurti, a member of the Congressional Oversight Commission that oversees the CARES Act funds and former adviser to Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \u201cStudent loan debt affects a lot of people \u2014 it\u2019s basically a fifth of all adults.\u201dStudent debt was a  during , a widespread protest movement that emerged in reaction to the global financial crisis in 2011. In the years following Occupy, activists continued to focus on the issue and push it into the conversation: In 2012, they organized  to mark student debt surpassing $1 trillion, and they subsequently launched  and fundraisers to help cancel student debt.  began to pop up across the country, where borrowers stopped paying their loans in protest of the situation, and organizers helped  to protect student borrowers against misleading and predatory practices.As student debt, which is, has become an increasingly prevalent issue, so have proposals regarding how to address it. In the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, Bernie Sanders , and  canceling debts of up to $50,000. Many Democrats and progressives are calling for Biden to cancel some or all debt through executive action, namely, a  that they argue would allow for debt to be canceled through executive authority. \u201cThe law is pretty clear that the secretary of education has the authority to compromise \u2014 that\u2019s the term \u2014 which means effectively cancel any individual debt of up to $1 million,\u201d said Ramamurti, who helped devise the plan Warren ran on. Now Warren and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer are  to cancel up to $50,000 in student loan debt with a resolution in the Senate. In the House, Reps. Ayanna Pressley (D-MA), Ilhan Omar (D-MN), Alma Adams (D-NC), and Maxine Waters (D-CA)  also calling for Biden to cancel debt. But as the idea has grown more popular, so has theresistance. On , detractors say it\u2019s a pointless government give-out. In , they warn it\u2019s not a good way to stimulate the economy. And on , there are concerns it\u2019s a regressive policy that will help people who don\u2019t need it. Some critics have  as a  that would help out the upper class (those who went to college) and do little, if anything, for everyone else, and some people have warned that such a bailout could prove a messaging disaster for Democrats. \u201cNo matter how it\u2019s designed, student-debt forgiveness is very poorly targeted,\u201d . \u201cEven if relief could be better focused on the poor, severe drawbacks remain. For one, the vast majority of Americans who don\u2019t have student debt would rightly feel left out. Many never had the opportunity to get a higher education; others put off financial goals (such as saving for retirement) to pay it down. Also, it would do  to improve the immediate cash flow of the many debtors who \u2014 because they\u2019re in default or in income-based repayment plans \u2014 are making small or no monthly payments.\u201dA  found that 51 percent of likely voters support forgiving student loan debt up to $50,000, especially if it is tied to national or community service or comes with a $125,000 income threshold. Only about one in four likely voters, however, supports forgiving all student debt. And the idea is much more popular among those with debt than those without it.Other polls have also found that canceling some student debt is a , though not the most popular idea in the world. And it is pretty well liked among members of the Democratic base \u2014 Black voters and middle-class professionals \u2014 who helped hand Biden the election.If Democrats do go ahead with student debt forgiveness via executive actions, they could pair it with something that would benefit non-college-educated people, such as  to pay a $15 minimum wage. That would benefit millions of workers. The Trump administration  through January 31, and Biden could continue to extend it. Still, leaving people in limbo month to month is not ideal.There are other steps Biden could take short of full debt cancellation, including improving programs to relieve debt for students defrauded by predatory schools or who signed up for programs that let them repay loans based on their income, loan forgiveness for people who go into public service, and debt relief for student veterans and students with disabilities, among others.But the big conversation has shifted to whether Biden should set students free from their debt \u2014 and if so, how much. The burden of student debt in America isn\u2019tequally shared. In 2019,  owed 56 percent of education debt, even though only 14 percent of adults over the age of 25 have graduate degrees, and the 3 percent of households with doctorates or professional degrees held 20 percent of all debt. Meanwhile, .Biden has backed  that would cancel $10,000 in debt, but unless Democrats take control of the Senate and make a big effort to push that through, that\u2019s not likely to become law.In terms of what advocates want Biden himself to do, the more conservative number rests around the $10,000 range, which is the number the president-elect had initially thrown his weight behind legislatively. Capping forgiveness at $10,000  and reduce by half the debt of 9 million more. Adam Looney, a nonresident fellow at the Brookings Institution and executive director of the Marriner S. Eccles Institute at the University of Utah, noted in a  that it would specifically help \u201cborrowers with smaller balances, who, paradoxically, tend to struggle most, accounting for 60 percent of all defaults.\u201dBorrowers who owe the least are often the ones who struggle most to pay their loans, in part because many of them are people who dropped out of school and aren\u2019t getting the benefit of a college degree in their careers.From the $10,000, the scale goes up. Schumer and Warren  to forgive $50,000. At the most ambitious end of the spectrum, , , and  want to cancel all federal student loan debt for everyone. Ramamurti told me he sees it as \u201cpurely a matter of political will,\u201d and once the mechanisms are in place, there\u2019s room for adjustment on forgiveness amounts and thresholds. \u201cThe nice thing about this policy is you can tweak it, depending on what your goals are,\u201d he said.When reached for comment, the Biden transition team pointed to  and noted his support for the $10,000 forgiveness legislation. In December, Biden told a group of newspaper columnists that he is \u201cunlikely\u201d to pursue student debt cancellation on his own. \u201cIt\u2019s arguable that the president may have the executive power to forgive up to $50,000 in student debt,\u201d Biden said in remarks first reported by . \u201cWell, I think that\u2019s pretty questionable. I\u2019m unsure of that. I\u2019d be unlikely to do that.\u201dAt the heart of the argument for canceling student debt, especially in the midst of the pandemic, is that it would be good for millions of people and, therefore, the economy. good is where the disagreement resides \u2014 and because mass student debt forgiveness isn\u2019t something we\u2019ve seen in the past, the data on what could happen is relatively limited.One  from Harvard Business School looked at what happened when students in default had their debt discharged because of a lawsuit. They found that borrowers reduced their overall indebtedness by a quarter and were also less likely to default on other accounts. That\u2019s good for them and for the entities they owe money to.\u201cWe actually find that these individuals tend to lower their total liabilities over time by repaying, for instance, credit card debt, so their overall financial health improves,\u201d said Marco Di Maggio, an associate professor of business administration at Harvard and one of the paper\u2019s authors.People also demonstrated more mobility \u2014 they moved states, changed jobs, and took more risks that often translated to higher incomes.Di Maggio\u2019s research focused on people who were in default and weren\u2019t making payments at all. But if it were broader federal debt forgiveness that includes borrowers who are paying, he thinks the impact could be much greater. \u201cIf you give the same type of forgiveness to people that are not in that situation, one effect that we don\u2019t capture is that your monthly payment is going down,\u201d he said. The $300 people were putting toward loan payments every month could then be spent elsewhere.Some critics have argued that student loan forgiveness , especially at higher amounts, because it would mean canceling debts for high-earning households. And there is disagreement among economists about just how effective stimulus forgiveness would be. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that advocates for fiscal responsibility,  that student loan forgiveness would have relatively small near-term multiplier effects, meaning the impact on the economy would be limited (and that\u2019s assuming it\u2019s tax-free \u2014 more on that later). \u201cWe found that it\u2019s all really poorly targeted stimulus,\u201d said Marc Goldwein, senior policy director at CRFB. \u201cIt would boost the economy, but by our estimates, for every $1 of loan forgiveness ... it would boost the economy by somewhere between 8 and 23 cents, which is a very poor multiplier.\u201dOther analysts disagree. Di Maggio estimates the multiplier to be at least $1 on every $1 \u2014 meaning that spending on forgiveness would directly boost the economy. A  from the Levy Economics Institute of Bard College projected that debt cancellation could boost GDP by tens of billions of dollars a year and reduce unemployment.Biden\u2019s appetite for loan forgiveness might even depend on how willing Congress is to do other stimulus. \u201cI would expect that student loan cancellation by executive action is more likely the extent to which the Republicans are blocking progress on a stimulus package through Congress,\u201d said Bob Shireman, the director of higher education excellence and a senior fellow at the Century Foundation. \u201cIt is definitely not one of the most effective ways to stimulate the economy, but if it is one of the things available to the administration, then it might be something they do.\u201dBut economic stimulus is not the only argument for wiping out debt. are disproportionately burdened with debt. From 2000 to 2018, the  for young white borrowers with a bachelor\u2019s degree about doubled from $12,000 to $23,000. For Black borrowers, it quadrupled, from $7,000 to $30,000, even though white families  more cumulative debt than Black families overall.  A  from Brandeis University found that 20 years after starting college, a typical Black borrower still owes 95 percent of their debt, while the typical white borrower has paid off 94 percent of their debt. Across socioeconomic levels,  than their white counterparts.\u201cBlack students borrow more often, they borrow more, and they have a harder time repaying than their peers,\u201d said Tiffany Jones, senior director of higher education policy at the Education Trust. \u201cThat\u2019s true all the way up the income ladder.\u201dForgiveness is a racial justice policy. A recent Roosevelt Institute  found that while white borrowers stand to gain the most in absolute dollars from cancellation, \u201cthe relative gains for Black borrowers are much larger and the greater proportion of Black borrowers means that Black wealth overall would experience much more growth as a result.\u201d They did not, however, find that it would meaningfully address the racial wealth gap.Darrick Hamilton, a professor of economics and urban policy and founding director of the Institute for the Study of Race, Stratification, and Political Economy at the New School, said the wealth gap isn\u2019t entirely the point.\u201cIf you\u2019re really trying to close the racial wealth gap, the main component, from an accounting standpoint, is assets, not debt,\u201d he said. \u201cDebt is problematic because it\u2019s almost like sharecropping \u2014 that\u2019s hyperbole \u2014 but it puts people in a debt trap where they are not permitted pathways for social mobility because they are constrained by a financier and the efforts of their labor go to pay off the interest on finance.\u201dAdvocates say the racial justice argument applies at the top and bottom of the income spectrum, for Black borrowers who are well-off and those who are not, and that narrow targeting isn\u2019t necessary. \u201cFolks are feeling like providing relief to a group that are high earners is probably not the right thing to do, forgetting and erasing that among high earners there are Black and brown people who would be impacted,\u201d Jones said.But student loan forgiveness could also be a restorative justice issue in that it would help right past wrongs. Higher education has long been held up as the gateway to a livable wage, and students have been encouraged to go into debt to go to school, build their r\u00e9sum\u00e9s, and advance. Now millions of young Americans are living through their second recession at the outset of their careers, and they\u2019re saddled with debt they were told was a good idea. Forgiveness could be \u201cstimulus to a generation that\u2019s been particularly scarred,\u201d Hamilton said.Frederick Wherry, a professor of sociology at Princeton University and director of the , emphasized that if student debt is canceled, \u201cit\u2019s also a good idea to cancel it in a way that\u2019s not denigrating for the debtors\u201d \u2014 making it easy to access instead of making people feel bad about jumping through hoops to reap the benefit.\u201cFor those who are already drowning and you are saying you want to do a stimulus, do a stimulus,\u201d Wherry said. \u201cNo one says anything when rich people get a tax break.\u201dOne major policy and political issue that hangs over the forgiveness discussion is taxes. Debt cancellation isgenerally counted as taxable income. So if someone has $50,000 in student loans forgiven, that would mean $50,000 would be counted as gross income for the year it was forgiven on top of other income. Under today\u2019s tax rates, that would be taxed likely somewhere between 22 and 37 percent. In other words, major student debt cancellation could come with an enormous tax bill for borrowers. Those who have studied the issue say there are workarounds. John Brooks, a law professor at the Georgetown University Law Center who has studied student debt taxes, told me that there are  that would allow the secretary of education, the treasury department, and the IRS to make forgiveness tax-free. Forgiveness could get a \u201cgeneral welfare\u201d exclusion, or qualify as disaster relief, or get a scholarship exclusion, among other options.\u201cStudent debt is just really, really weird, and it just doesn\u2019t fit into the categories and the ways we think about other kinds of debt,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a form of government funding for higher education, and it\u2019s designed to provide as many people as possible with a way to get over some degree of affordability problems that\u2019s limiting their ability to enroll in higher education.\u201dJessica Thompson, associate vice president at the Institute for College Access & Success (TICAS), said the case that there\u2019s a preexisting legal way around taxes on cancellation is \u201cdefinitely more in question\u201d than forgiveness proponents would like, though there\u2019s an argument to be made. \u201cYou can make your case, but in the end, you\u2019ve got to meet every single hurdle that could be thrown at you,\u201d she said. \u201cTreasury and the IRS tend to be conservative and careful about how they interpret their authority to act.\u201dIt\u2019s worth emphasizing that the tax issue isn\u2019t limited to the current executive action forgiveness question \u2014 the assumption for people repaying loans through programs that eventually forgive any remaining balance is that they\u2019ll owe taxes, too. So this problem is going to show up whether there\u2019s mass cancellation or not.The conversation the United States is having right now around student debt cancellation isn\u2019t a new one \u2014 it\u2019s the result of years of activism, organizing, and thinking among people who think it\u2019s a good, just, and right idea. But this is also indicative of the moment: Millions of Americans are hurting and in desperate need of help amid the Covid-19 pandemic, especially as much of the federal stimulus already provided has run out or is about to. Debt forgiveness may be an outlet for the Biden administration to be creative and nimble in addressing the crisis.\u201cAny debt relief is better than what\u2019s happening right now,\u201d Jones said.But wiping out debt is only part of the equation when it comes to the cost of higher education in the United States. Even if you cancel all existing debt, you have students in school or about to go to school who are going to wind up stuck in the same loop.\u201cEvery breath that you hear someone talking about debt cancellation, we need to be talking about the urgency of people who are in school right now and people who should be in school right now,\u201d Thompson said.That translates to issues such as making college more affordable, keeping students away from predatory institutions, and fostering degrees and training that are worth the money. The issue on those fronts is that Biden can\u2019t do much on his own.\u201cWe need a Congress that\u2019s willing to have that conversation,\u201d the Century Foundation\u2019s Shireman said. \u201cWe cannot address the broader affordability questions, the broader affordability problem, without Congress and the administration working together.\u201dIs widespread student debt cancellation the optimal path toward stimulus? Reasonable minds can disagree, but probably not. But if there\u2019s ever a time to try it, the moment could be now.\n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

{"article_title": ["How we can encourage people to wear masks \u2014 for others\u2019 sake "], "article_body": "Governors, mayors, and public health officials are sounding the alarm about rising levels of  across every part of the country. The disease is surging, the death toll is soaring, and it\u2019s clear that some states need more restrictive measures to control the spread.What continues to frustrate so many leaders is that nine months into this pandemic, science and data have painted a clear path for how to beat the virus and reduce transmission. But the disappointing and deadly truth is that in many cases, it\u2019s difficult to get Americans to follow the rules. Boosted by a president who celebrates breaking rules and deliberately defies science and time-tested norms of civility, millions of Americans have been flagrantly flouting simple requests to wear masks in public, to refrain from congregating in large groups, or to limit their unnecessary travel. With the rule-makers themselves  the recommendations of experts and scientists of their own administration, rule-breaking Americans have quickly followed. As it happens, the US loves rule breakers; the ethos of breaking with tradition is in our country\u2019s DNA. New Hampshire\u2019s state motto is   famously celebrate rugged individualism, the country\u2019s founders are revered as rebels who defied a demanding government, and even a reality TV star could be elected president. But in a pandemic, what public health officials are pleading for is a little more conformity. Flattening the curve requires Americans to all take fairly uniform actions \u2014 wearing masks, not gathering \u2014 for the betterment of the whole of society. It isn\u2019t a time to bristle at being \u201ctold what to do.\u201d President-elect Joe Biden has already signaled that he intends, unlike President Trump, to follow the science and issue a national . While we wait for the months-long rollout of a vaccine to hundreds of millions of Americans, people must fall in line with this and other public health recommendations if there\u2019s to be any hope of beating the virus. But will they? While it may seem unlikely that Biden and public health officials can really encourage many more Americans to follow rules, there are ways to bring Americans together to support conformity. This, in turn, could help get Americans through the last several months of the pandemic with tens of thousands of fewer lives lost. It\u2019s important to think carefully about the message, because there\u2019s more than one type of conformity. The type we think about most often \u2014 self-focused conformity \u2014 describes actions taken to fit in with a group. (These can be conspicuous inactions, too, such as some Trump supporters refusing to wear masks.)But my  with collaborator Matthew Wice, assistant professor of psychology at SUNY New Paltz, looks at others-focused conformity, what we call \u201cbenevolent conformity,\u201d and shows how following norms or rules can benefit others. In one study, we asked more than 300 participants to think back to a time when they saw someone conform to their group. Some participants were asked to think about an instance when someone conformed because they wanted others to like them. Others were asked to think about a time when someone conformed for others\u2019 sake. We then asked all of our participants to report what they thought about this person whose public behavior differed from their privately held beliefs. Did this person have a strong moral character? Were they competent people? Were they kind and friendly?While participants in our research scoffed at conformity when it was perceived as selfish, they respected and appreciated benevolent conformity, seeing it as courageous and praiseworthy. Our experiments showed that Americans found people who conform to protect others\u2019 feelings or to maintain group harmony to be warmer, more competent, and more authentic. This is a key lesson for Biden and for governors who seek to enforce conformity to help protect people from a deadly virus. They should emphasize that sometimes conformity takes courage. This point should be made loud and clear: In the battle against Covid-19, the courageous and commendable thing to do is to put other people first. So when presented with the idea that following Covid-19 safety measures is \u201c\u201d or \u201cun-American,\u201d public health experts should flip this argument on its head: emphasize the benefits of people\u2019s helpful actions. Wherever possible, leaders must employ the benevolent conformity Americans seem to gravitate toward and respect. Emphasizing a  can remind Americans that the real reason for adhering to safety measures is not just to fit in, but also to protect the group to which they belong. When adhering to simple safety measures can save tens of thousands of American lives, wearing a mask is not an act of blind obedience, it is an act of patriotism. As vaccines begin to be deployed (with vaccine ) and the pandemic reaching new heights, this kind of messaging will be increasingly urgent to get us back on track. Our research makes one thing clear: Americans love rule breakers, but they also hold a special place in their heart for benevolent, other-focused rule followers. If 2020 has shown us anything, it\u2019s that sometimes, we need to conform for others\u2019 sake. \n    Millions rely on Vox\u2019s journalism to understand the coronavirus crisis.

{"article_title": ["A Christmas Carol, explained by a 5-year-old"], "article_body": ", Charles Dickens\u2019s beloved novella about a miserly old man and the three ghosts who visit to teach him about the spirit of Christmas, is one of my favorite stories ever written.I\u2019ve loved it since I was a child obsessed with the 1983 animated short starring beloved Disney characters in the major roles. Nominated for an Oscar,  proved a boon to the studio\u2019s animation division at a time when it was flailing. It also became a regular feature of Christmas TV for much of my childhood, turning up every year to retell its familiar tale.What surprised me to learn as a kid was that there have been many adaptations of , across all manner of genres and styles and characters. If there\u2019s a beloved troupe of characters, the odds are good that they\u2019ve taken a crack at  at one point or another. Mr. Magoo has played Scrooge. Fred Flintstone has played Scrooge. Yosemite Sam has played Scrooge. And, of course, Scrooge McDuck has played Scrooge, opposite Mickey Mouse\u2019s Bob Cratchit. I loved this story, so I consumed as many versions as I could.My childhood also saw the release of a different adaptation of this story that has stood the test of time: the 1992 film , with Kermit the Frog as Bob Cratchit, Statler and Waldorf as Jacob and Robert Marley, and the very human Michael Caine as Scrooge (in one of the renowned thespian\u2019s best performances). A bit of a box office and critical disappointment at its release,  has gone on to become a holiday classic for many. But I wondered what a child of today might make of both  and , and fortunately for me, I just happen to know Vox\u2019s esteemed critic at small, Eliza, who is 5 and 5/12. (I doubt the copy desk will let me put that in the headline. Sorry, Eliza, for mis-aging you.) Eliza and I sat down to talk about just what makes  so timeless and what makes an adaptation of the story successful. When you\u2019ve watched , you start to spot small, telling differences among them. Which story elements from the original work do screenwriters choose to prioritize over others? And which story elements do they leave out entirely? Even a book as slim as  can\u2019t be adapted with 100 percent faithfulness, and any given screenwriter must make choices about whether to underline the ghost story, the good Christmas cheer, the story of an old man\u2019s regret, Dickens\u2019s social conscience, or the occasional stabs at dry humor. There are a bunch of possible takes hiding within this one tale, and each is as valid as the last.\n    Related\n   mostly chooses to make Dickens come to Disney, rather than sending Disney to Dickens. The special borrows the familiar story elements and sends them through the Disney prism, so that, say, Goofy is playing the ghost of Jacob Marley, while Jiminy Cricket plays the Ghost of Christmas Past. At the center is Alan Young as Scrooge McDuck, and his performance is the special\u2019s greatest asset. (Young had first played Scrooge McDuck in a  that was largely adapted for .)The special\u2019s tone lurches all over the place, something that is not helped by its 25-minute runtime. It\u2019s surprising it comes together at all \u2014 there\u2019s no way the slapstick of Goofy should work with the creepiness of Marley\u2019s ghost, but it kinda does \u2014 but it\u2019s always hampered by being a Disney production first and a Dickens adaptation second. In the end, it suggests that the moral of this story is mostly \u201cBe nice to other people, okay?\u201d which is a good lesson to impart but not really the focus of the novella. is altogether stronger. It doesn\u2019t force the Muppet characters into roles they wouldn\u2019t fit particularly well, so that Michael Caine\u2019s work as Scrooge can have the weight it requires. (He\u2019s one of the .) But it does allow, say, Fozzie Bear to step in as Fezziwig \u2014 or should I say Fozziwig \u2014 which is exactly the sort of tiny, comedic cameo where one of the sillier Muppets can be very funny.\n    Related\n   finds a great middle ground between the book and the Muppets, right down to having Gonzo (as Charles Dickens) recite chunks of text from the book directly to viewers (with Rizzo the Rat on hand to provide comic relief). It\u2019s not my favorite adaptation of this story, but it\u2019s darn close.Eliza, what did you see as the chief adaptation choices made by these two specials? looked like Sesame Street, and  was a cartoon. The Spirit of Yet to Come in  had eyes [in its hood].  one didn\u2019t have eyes and was gray with lines. The  one was brown. Plus, when the  spirit threw Scrooge in fire, he said, \u201cSCROOOOOOOOOGE!\u201d and the other one was way more quiet. Oh! I was going to ask something about  Why did the Spirit of the Future drop Donald Duck, who was playing Scrooge, in fire?[desperately trying not to explain hell to a child] Well, uh, it was to show he had been bad. And if he stayed bad, he would go and get burned up.[looking very concerned] Oh.But that\u2019s only if you\u2019re bad. [disconcertingly long pause] He was pretty bad. Wait. Donald Duck doesn\u2019t play Scrooge in ! He plays Scrooge\u2019s nephew, Fred.No, that\u2019s a smaller girl duck.All right.Few characters in English literature are as memorable as Ebenezer Scrooge, who (if nothing else) shows off Dickens\u2019s skill for naming characters with exactly the right series of syllables, such that you instantly understand who they are. Hundreds, if not thousands, of people have played Scrooge over the years. It\u2019s impossible to get an exact count, since stage adaptations of  remain staples of regional theaters and the like. But  on Scrooge\u2019s Wikipedia page is formidable, with seemingly every actor over 40 with a patrician air and stentorian bluster having taken a crack at the part. Why just this year,  played Scrooge from the stage of London\u2019s Old Vic. Scrooge has become such an immortal character because he somehow speaks to our worst and best selves. There are days when we want to say \u201chumbug\u201d to the world and days when we\u2019re so full of good feeling that we could pop. We want to believe that it\u2019s not too late to change our ways, and Christmas often brings out a fond feeling for our fellow human beings. Eliza, did you like Scrooge?I didn\u2019t like him at first, but then I liked him!What didn\u2019t you like about him?[excited] The movie is kind of like the Grinch! Eliza! A deliberate comparison between two disparate works! That\u2019s the backbone of much critical analysis!The Grinch didn\u2019t like Christmas. But what\u2019s different about the two movies is that the Grinch stole Christmas, and Scrooge doesn\u2019t do that.Yeah, you\u2019re right.Scrooge doesn\u2019t have that level of ambition. Broadly speaking,  fits into a  of telling ghost stories during the Christmas season. Indeed, there are spooky Christmas stories stretching back to medieval times, and ghosts popping up at such a festive time of year were one of the handful of Christmas traditions hanging on in Dickens\u2019s day. \n    Related\n  In 1843, when Dickens published , Christmas was often treated as just another day, with few people even getting time off work \u2014 that\u2019s why Bob Cratchit asks if he can have the day off. So  is an attempt to reinstate Christmas as an important holiday on both a plot level (the characters are taught to keep Christmas every day of the year) and a more metatextual level (a Christmas ghost story would have seemed properly festive to Dickens\u2019s readers).But forget all that heady nonsense. I just love . What about you, Eliza? Who were your favorite Christmas spirits?The Spirit of Christmas Present in . He opens the roof of a house, and the person inside goes \u201cEEEEEK!\u201d: I like when he goes right up next to the window, and his eye\u2019s really big.And I like Jacob and Robert Marley from ! My favorite song is \u201cMarley and Marley.\u201d Great song. A real bop. Which one of the ghosts would you want to be?I would want to be the Spirit of Christmas Past. Too bad I couldn\u2019t fly for real into the past! I would go back in time to all the Christmases and get all the [Lego] Advent calendars that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve done three, and four when we\u2019ve finished this one. I\u2019ll get all the other boxes that have been thrown away, and I\u2019ll bring them home to the present.I think the ghosts are cool. I wish I could meet the ghosts.Me too! It\u2019s too bad that all the people in the world can\u2019t be the ghosts. If everybody wanted to, they could be the ghosts, but if one person or two or maybe 100 didn\u2019t want to, they could just not be it. [pause] I wish I could just go through the screen, so we could talk and interview in person. I\u2019d like that! I\u2019ll have to come visit when all of this is over!Then you could meet my whole family!Well, I\u2019ve met your mom and your dad, and I met you when you were a baby. : Yeah, but you haven\u2019t met my grandpa and grandma! And you\u2019re in luck! I\u2019ve got  grandpas and grandmas. I don\u2019t have any grandpas or grandmas anymore. Why?[aggressively backpedals][Eliza\u2019s younger sister, Nora, the critic at tiny who is 2 and 3/4, enters the room.]Nora! You should ask your question![Nora approaches and whispers something in Eliza\u2019s ear.]Ask her!You can\u2019t write with a leaf! A leaf? Oh, a feather! Mickey and Donald Duck paint with a quill. She wants to know why they do that?Well, they\u2019re just writing with them. They\u2019re not painting. People would take feathers and make the tips really sharp. Then they would dip them in little ink pots and write things down. But now we have pens, and those are just a lot easier to use.My drawing desk has a little circle to put a bottle of ink in, and then you can put a pen in it. It\u2019s George\u2019s desk. He lived in our house before we did. Does that answer your question, Nora?[stares]is one of the . Almost everyone alive knows some version of this story, and there are plenty of adaptations that have nothing to do with Christmas at all. (See also: McConaughey, Matthew, in .) Dickens\u2019s story is beautifully structured, appropriately festive, and just the right amount of creepy. It\u2019s no wonder so many filmmakers have tried their hand at adapting it, though many have failed.Eliza, why do you think this story has endured so long?Because it\u2019s about Christmas.I like the way it\u2019s about looking at your life and seeing the things that should and could be better and using Christmas as a way to make your life better and be a better person. But I also like the ghosts. I wish I could meet the ghosts.Me too!I\u2019m gonna ask you the question I always ask you: Who is the character you are the most similar to?I don\u2019t know.I think you\u2019re the most similar to that little bunny who carries the turkey in  , because you\u2019re nice and you like to help. Who\u2019s your mom most similar to?Maybe the bunny?I think I\u2019m most similar to one of the Cratchits, because I have to work and work for a boss who doesn\u2019t appreciate me, and all the ink gets frozen \u2014WHOAAAAAAAAA!Mom, you\u2019re in the middle of the bunny and Scrooge. That\u2019s a good answer.Your mom is nothing like Scrooge, Eliza. Not even a little bit.I know who\u2019s like Scrooge! Who?Donald Trump!Wow. Eliza with the hot takes. I hope he\u2019s visited by three ghosts this Christmas, who convince him to change his ways.Me too.This article originally said  was published in 1863. It was published in 1843.

{"article_title": ["Fox News\u2019s post-Trump identity crisis, explained by an expert"], "article_body": "As its main meal ticket prepares to leave office, Fox News is struggling through an identity crisis.For the better part of five years, Fox and Donald Trump have enjoyed a symbiotic relationship. Trump\u2019s habitual watching of Fox and the willingness both he and other administration officials have had to be interviewed on Fox News and Fox Business brought the network to unprecedented heights of relevance, while Fox has helped Trump by  through .But Trump\u2019s relationship with Fox hasn\u2019t been all sunshine and rainbows. Even while the vast majority of the network\u2019s programming did his bidding in one way or another, Trump has repeatedly  \u2014 and the one-sided feud has escalated dramatically since his loss to Joe Biden.\u201cOn a fundamental level Fox has been operating as a propaganda arm of President Trump, but the president has never really been satisfied with the level of obsequiousness he sometimes sees when he turns on his television,\u201d Matt Gertz, senior fellow at Media Matters for America, told me. Things came to a boiling point in the days following the election. Fox News\u2019s \u201cnews side,\u201d such as it is, was among the first on election night to call Arizona for Joe Biden. Its decision to do so sent President Donald Trump . Though the state didn\u2019t end up being central to most networks\u2019 decisions to call the race for Joe Biden, it was a symbolic turning point during a night that quickly went from hopeful to sour for the president. He\u2019s spent the past six weeks seemingly more focused on settling scores with Fox News than he has been on the coronavirus pandemic. . daytime ratings have completely collapsed. Weekend daytime even WORSE. Very sad to watch this happen, but they forgot what made them successful, what got them there. They forgot the Golden Goose. The biggest difference between the 2016 Election, and 2020, was !Trump apparently isn\u2019t alone in feeling betrayed. At his urging, many of his followers have turned off Fox News and are watching  and  \u2014 Trumpier alternatives to Fox News, which at least during the daytime hours still likes to think of itself as a news channel and not a Trump propaganda network.. daytime is not watchable. In a class with CNN & MSDNC. Check out ,  and others that are picking up the slack. Even a boring football game, kneeling and all, is better!To give you a flavor for their programming, OAN is refusing to refer to President-elect Biden as \u201cPresident-elect,\u201d based on lies about there being \u201c.\u201d Newsmax, meanwhile, recently did an interview with former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn in which Flynn mused about a military coup to keep Trump in office \u2014 shocking comments that received no pushback from the host.Here's Michael Flynn on Newsmax saying that Trump could order \"military capabilities\" to swing states and \"rerun an election in each of those states.\"\"People out there talk about martial law like it's something that we've never done. Martial law has been instituted 64 times.\" Believe it or not, this coverage is resonating. While they still lag far behind Fox News overall, ratings for Newsmax and OAN have surged since the election while Fox\u2019s have stagnated. In a major milestone, Newsmax earlier this month even  over an hour of programming. Fox, meanwhile, is also feeling pressure from the saner end of the spectrum. CNN\u2019s  and at times have been better than Fox. For the first time in 20 years, Fox News can no longer boast that it\u2019s clearly the top dog in cable news.Trump can\u2019t totally quit Fox News, however. While he lambasts the network\u2019s \u201cnews side,\u201d he still habitually live tweets broadcasts hosted by his favorites, such as Sean Hannity and Mark Levin. During a  interview on election morning, Trump even bashed Fox News while on Fox News.Brian Kilmeade gives Trump the opportunity to respond to Obama and instead he lays out his grievances against Fox for sometimes airing Biden speeches before listing all the hosts he likes. Along similar lines, Trump\u2019s first post-election was on Maria Bartiromo\u2019s Sunday morning Fox News show. And as is , Bartiromo let Trump lie with impunity.Trump's own lawyers conceded in court that the claim he makes here about poll watchers is a lie -- but Maria Bartiromo lets Trump lie with impunity To unpack right-wing cable news\u2019s tumultuous situation and where things might go in a post-President Trump world, I talked to Gertz, the Media Matters senior fellow and close observer of the right-wing news TV ecosystem. During the Trump years, Gertz has distinguished himself as perhaps the foremost chronicler of the Fox News-to-Trump pipeline. He\u2019s tirelessly traced Trump\u2019s tweets back to the Fox News segments that inspire them \u2014 even when Trump is watching and tweeting programming that aired hours or days earlier. The president of the United States is so busy that he's watching a recording of a Fox Business show that aired Sunday morning and tweeting about it.Left, Fox Business' Sunday Morning Futures, 10:24 a.m. yesterdayRight, Trump, 8:37 a.m. As the president has started watching more Newsmax and OAN, so has Gertz.An ongoing shift in the president's viewing habits from Fox to the even more conspiracy-minded OAN. Left, OAN, 7:46 a.m.Right, Trump, 8:14 a.m. As Gertz explained to me, even in a post-Trump world, he still expects Fox News to play a leading role in setting the conservative agenda, since \u201cthey have the biggest audience and the biggest propensity to produce dangerous misinformation that shifts the public discussion, and the state of policy in this country.\u201dBut Gertz sees signs that Fox News is bowing to the pressure Trump and his supporters are putting on it.\u201cWe\u2019re also seeing a sort of race to the bottom in certain ways. I think Fox has really kicked up the amount of coverage it\u2019s done in support of President Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election because they\u2019re feeling some heat from competitors,\u201d he said. \u201cSo that, I think, is part of the real risk behind all of us \u2014 that it will [increase] Fox\u2019s need to become ever more conspiracy-minded in years to come.\u201dA transcript of our conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity, follows.I thought maybe a good place to start is with your cable news diet. I know you watch a lot of it. What have you on a typical day been watching over the past four years, and has that changed from 2017 to today?I\u2019ve been at Media Matters since 2007, so I\u2019ve been in one way or another immersed in this right-wing media world ever since. A lot of my work has focused very specifically on Fox News during the Trump administration, and the way in which its hosts and its shows have become intertwined with President Trump and with other members of his team.A lot of that has been focused on , the president\u2019s favorite morning news show. I generally have that network on from early in the morning throughout the day. I will catch clips from shows later that night and read the transcripts the next morning to make sure that I have a good sense of what was going on on all of those primetime and later shows.But Fox News has been at the center of the conservative media infrastructure for that entire time, and so it\u2019s been my main focus.Perhaps the biggest development in cable news since the election has been the sudden rise of Newsmax and OAN as in some sense alternatives to Fox News that are further right. Shockingly, Newsmax\u2019s ratings even beat Fox News in a key demographic over an hour of programming earlier this month.Do you think this is all attributable to Trump and his fans feeling betrayed by Fox\u2019s infamous somewhat early call of Arizona for Biden? Or is there something else going on here?On a fundamental level, Fox has been operating as a propaganda arm of President Trump, but the president has never really been satisfied with the level of obsequiousness he sometimes sees when he turns on his television. He\u2019s watching as much as or more Fox as I am \u2014 and to some extent, I do that for a living \u2014 and so when he sees things on his television that he doesn\u2019t like, when he sees Democrats appearing on the network, when he sees some of the more so-called \u201cnews side\u201d shows presenting Fox polling that shows him losing various states, when he sees the state of Arizona getting called for his opponent and then Fox acknowledging Joe Biden is the president-elect, he becomes infuriated. This has happened throughout the administration. We have seen here and there, he will lash out at Fox for not going far enough in his favor, and he\u2019s even from time to time told his supporters that they should be watching OAN or Newsmax instead. But since the election, since his defeat, he has been willing to do that on a far more consistent basis. He has made the criticisms of Fox News much more frequently on his Twitter feed, and he\u2019s actually watching the other networks much more than he used to as well.I\u2019ve been tracking Trump\u2019s so-called \u201clive tweets,\u201d the cases where he responds in real time to what he\u2019s seeing on the television with tweets, since October 2017. And he\u2019s never sent tweets about that network\u2019s competitors the way he has over the past few weeks. He\u2019s sent about the same number of tweets between November 15 and December 2 of this year in response to OAN segments as he had over a two-year period.Looking back at Trump live-tweets since Nov. 19, I count:Fox News/Business: 11OAN: 10Newsmax: 3Trump sent only 12 OAN live-tweets total over a recent two-year span, compared to more than 1,200 Fox News/Business. So his own viewing habits are changing, and he is getting at least some slice of his supporters to change their viewing habits as well. Do you think it\u2019ll be sustainable for Newsmax and OAN to continue on as basically Trump propaganda outlets after he leaves office? I wonder if there\u2019s going to be the staying power in terms of filtering all the news through a Trump prism a year or two after he leaves office.I don\u2019t know. I think what seems pretty clear is that Fox is trying to forestall that by shifting its programming in certain ways. I have been seeing during the so-called \u201cstraight news\u201d hours that Fox has started airing clips of its primetime hosts to set up various segments. They\u2019ll air 15 seconds of Tucker Carlson talking about a topic before going into their own discussion about it, or playing a clip from Sean Hannity\u2019s show and asking guests to respond. So that\u2019s the way in which they\u2019re trying to change things up a little bit to push back on these competitors.Fox \"straight news\" broadcast America's Newsroom is increasingly a show about what happened in Fox prime-time the previous night. We\u2019re also seeing a sort of race to the bottom in certain ways. I think Fox has really kicked up the amount of coverage it\u2019s done in support of President Trump\u2019s effort to overturn the election because they\u2019re feeling some heat from competitors. So that I think is part of the real risk behind all of this \u2014 that it will [increase] Fox\u2019s need to become ever more conspiracy-minded in years to come.It does seem there\u2019s been a divide between Fox\u2019s daytime programming with Neil Cavuto and Chris Wallace and the primetime lineup. I\u2019ve noticed as well that they\u2019re now treating Hannity clips as though they\u2019re newsworthy, and then framing panel discussions around them. But what I hear you saying is that to the extent that Fox News is going to have to choose, you see them shifting more in the direction of making their daytime content more like their primetime content than the other way around.Yes, I think that is certainly the case. There is no movement in the opposite direction \u2014 there is no indication that the network is considering becoming a better source of information to its viewers. And there\u2019s really a problem there. Fox\u2019s viewers to some extent are counting on the network to provide them with credible information, so when I look back on the past 10 months of pandemic coverage that the network has produced, they\u2019re lying to their viewers about how much danger they are in from a deadly pandemic, because they think that\u2019s better for President Trump and their ratings than leveling with their audience about the real physical danger they are in.Dec. 8: Laura Ingraham criticizes the \"concerted campaign to vilify and dismiss and demean, and frankly lie about it, the ineffectiveness of\" hydroxychloroquine.This alternative history that lets Trump off the hook will be a permanent feature of right-wing commentary. I think you\u2019re right to identify what\u2019s in Trump\u2019s interest as motivating a lot of the editorial choices that Fox has made in recent years, but where do you see that going in the months to come under a President Biden? Do you anticipate that there will be fealty to Trump, even if it\u2019s more about appeasing their viewers?I\u2019ve noticed in some of their programming it seems like they\u2019re repositioning themselves as these gadflies chastising the media for not covering Hunter Biden more, or calling out liberal hypocrisy. lots of tears being shed on Fox News' Outnumbered Overtime today How much do you think Trump\u2019s interests will drive editorial choices going forward?Fox News always takes on the character of the Republican Party of the era. I think their hope is that they can make a return to what the network was like in 2009, 2010. That\u2019s when it emerged as the voice of opposition to President Obama, and they spent eight years fighting his administration on every front possible.I think their fear, though, is that this competition from OAN and Newsmax will lock them into this current role as a Trump propaganda arm, that they won\u2019t be able to establish any distance or even move away from constantly talking about Trump once he\u2019s out of office.I know Media Matters has been involved in  who are doing business with Fox News shows when hosts have said offensive things. What\u2019s the scene like with Newsmax and OAN? Do they have robust ad content on those networks?Not really. Neither of them, and OAN in particular, don\u2019t have large ratings. And that keeps them from, certainly, getting blue-chip advertisers. We\u2019re seeing a lot more MyPillow ads on Newsmax in particular over the last several weeks. [MyPillow] has a conservative owner, they very much try to own that particular demographic, and so they have a ton of ads really propping up Tucker Carlson\u2019s show in particular on Fox.Four different My Pillow ads for four different products, all of which ran on Tucker Carlson's show tonight. But this is where they are different. Fox is a propaganda network that sometimes does conspiracy theories but depends on the existence of this \u201cnews side\u201d that they say is unbiased and like a normal network\u2019s, in order to keep blue-chip advertisers on board with at least some of those shows. OAN is a conspiracy theory network that sometimes does propaganda. It\u2019s not in the Nielsen ratings because it doesn\u2019t reach a lot of people. Newsmax is a little bit different. Newsmax is a grift. The thing you have to understand about Newsmax is that it\u2019s an unprofitable TV business that\u2019s welded onto a very profitable digital and newsletter business. And the reason it\u2019s profitable is that it sells out its audience of older conservatives to an assortment of scammers and snake oil salesmen.So they\u2019re using Trump\u2019s current feud with Fox to build a bigger audience for themselves. They want to pull those people into their ecosystem and then pitch new viewers on nutritional supplements and the efficacy of natural cures for Alzheimer\u2019s, and financial products that protect your savings from the coming waves of hyperinflation \u2014 it\u2019s absolutely disgusting, but that\u2019s where their money comes.There\u2019s been a lot of speculation that after he leaves office, Trump will get involved in right-wing TV in some capacity, whether it\u2019s with his own network or his own show on an existing network. He seems pretty committed at this point to aligning himself with OAN and Newsmax while distancing himself from Fox, but do you think there\u2019s a chance any of those networks would give him his own show?I\u2019m skeptical about a lot of these ideas until I see them actually move forward in some way. Starting your own network from scratch is a huge business endeavor that requires a lot of time and effort and money and relationships, and so I really am not expecting to see the fabled \u201cTrump TV\u201d outlet emerge. I could be wrong about that, but I\u2019ll be skeptical until I see some actual movement on it.It\u2019s hard for me to imagine Newsmax offering him enough money to make it actually worthwhile. Or certainly OAN \u2014 I don\u2019t really see that happening either. The president wants to be able to go on  and talk with Sean Hannity, and so he\u2019s gonna do something that lets him keep doing that. My guess has continued to be that the best way he can make money off his post-presidency is stage shows. Basically Trump rallies, but for profit. That seems like a thing he could do that doesn\u2019t involve a lot of work, and frankly I\u2019m skeptical he will do anything in the media that does require a lot of work.I mean, his interviews are basically riffing. You could imagine him maybe doing some sort of digital streaming show where, again, he doesn\u2019t need to do much but sit in front of a camera and mug and do his stream of consciousness about the issues of the day. But my thing on this is that the continuum is from \u201cthings that won\u2019t happen because they are a lot of work\u201d to \u201cthings that could happen because they are not a lot of work.\u201dTo bring things full circle, what do you anticipate your cable news diet will look like post-Trump? What does a new president mean for what you\u2019ll be paying attention to and perhaps live-tweeting?I think it could end up being a lot more fractured. The media environment in general has become a lot more fractured over the past several years, and if some of these cable news networks do get more of a footprint, they\u2019ll be worth tuning in to now and again. There are also plenty of conservative digital outlets I\u2019ll be paying attention to, since they can feed into the rest of the discourse.But I imagine I\u2019ll still be paying a lot of attention to Fox News. They have the biggest audience and the biggest propensity to produce dangerous misinformation that shifts the public discussion and the state of policy in this country.\n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

{"article_title": ["Study: Smoking bans saved countless lives \u2014 could they have increased drunk driving?"], "article_body": "Alcohol has , and the US doesn\u2019t take that seriously enough. While America may have taken smoking more seriously, it continues to kill nearly half a million people every year. Alcohol-related deaths number almost 100,000 annually. A new  by Anne Burton, an economics PhD candidate at Cornell University, looked into how smoking bans at bars and restaurants affected alcohol consumption, violent crime, and fatal drunk-driving crashes. Her most notable finding was a 4 percent increase in fatal drunk-driving crashes associated with the implementation of these bans in areas with high levels of smoking. If accurate, this would be a significant harm policymakers need to consider when designing other policies that attempt to curb the use of harmful substances.While smoking bans indoors have become pretty ubiquitous,this research may have new relevance as states begin liberalizing marijuana laws and cracking down on e-cigarettes and vaping. Policymakers have to determine if tamping down or easing up on drug restrictions affects the use of other potentially dangerous substances. If legalizing marijuana has the unintended consequence of increasing cigarette usage or cracking down on e-cigarettes pushes those consumers to smoke cigarettes more, that\u2019s a big problem. Burton\u2019s research looks to see if a policy that worked to stop smoking actually could have led people to drink more and led to measurable increases in drunk driving fatalities. But first \u2014 from one drinker to another () \u2014 why drinking and smoking are actually very, very bad and why we should care if more of it happens:From 1999 to 2017, a  by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) tracked nearly a million alcohol-related deaths in the United States. In a 2010 National Bureau of Economic Research , researchers systematically reviewed the existing evidence linking alcohol and violent crimes and concluded that the \u201cextensively documented correlations\u201d between alcohol and crime represent \u201c\u2018true\u2019 causal effects of alcohol use on crime commission.\u201d That\u2019s a big deal. That means the researchers believe it\u2019s not just an association and that some other factor is making people both drink heavily and commit crimes \u2014 it\u2019s that alcohol is a big factor in whether some crimes even happen at all.\u201cThe number one substance that is involved in arrests and incarceration is alcohol in the United States,\u201d Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert and professor of psychiatry at Stanford University, told me. \u201cIn terms of the damage \u2014 people think of illegal drugs as the drivers of the criminal justice system, [but] none of them come close to alcohol.\u201dHowever, as a country, we\u2019ve been overwhelmingly focused on regulating other drugs. My colleague German Lopez wrote a piece titled  Here\u2019s my favorite excerpt: What\u2019s worse, public use of this drug has become widely accepted in some circles. In New Orleans, several men and women in their 20s and 30s shouted that they\u2019re going to get \u201cwasted\u201d \u2014 a slang term for coming under the effects of alcohol. Some have even turned drinking alcohol into a game that involves ping pong balls and cups. One popular holiday, St. Patrick\u2019s Day, appears to  the dangerous drug...No other drug comes close to the staggering fatalities of these two. Illicit fentanyl, which has consumed widespread media attention due to the opioid epidemic in the past few years, was linked to fewer than 30,000 overdose deaths in 2017. And marijuana \u2014 another drug that federal law enforcement officials have warned is dangerous \u2014 reportedly caused zero overdose deaths in the past few thousand years.Cigarettes are also extremely bad for health \u2014 though we\u2019ve done more as a country to combat their use. They remain the  in the US, killing more than 480,000 people every year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   that \u201cfor every person who dies because of smoking, at least 30 people live with a serious smoking-related illness.\u201dBurton wasn\u2019t the first to study smoking bans and their relationship with alcohol consumption as well as events associated with drinking like drunk driving and violent crime. Economists Scott Adams and Chad Cotti of the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee and UW Oshkosh, respectively, looked into the relationship between smoking bans and drunk driving between 2000 and 2005. They began their  by noting that \u201cthe expected effect of smoking bans on drunk driving is ambiguous\u201d since smokers might choose to go out less, lowering the number of people drinking in total. However, their research indicates that \u201cfatal accidents involving a drunk driver increase by about 13 percent\u201d following the implementation of a smoking ban \u2014 an astonishing finding. Adams and Cotti looked into what might be happening here, and after reviewing case studies they settled on two theories. The first is \u201ccross-border shopping,\u201d where smokers are willing to drive farther to go to a bar in a neighboring jurisdiction that allows smoking, thereby increasing the number of miles driven after drinking. One example they point to is Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota, which is one large metropolitan area split into two counties. Hennepin County, where Minneapolis is, enacted a smoking ban in 2005, after which there was a 12 percent increase in fatal accidents in Ramsey County, which contains St. Paul.The second theory is that bars are differentiating themselves within jurisdictions with smoking bans by providing outdoor seating or by not enforcing the ban, and that is leading smokers to drive more as well. Burton\u2019s study, which builds on this research, looked at smoking bans in bars and restaurants from 2004 to 2012. She pulled from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the Nielsen Consumer Panel to measure alcohol consumption and the location of alcohol consumption by smoking status. She turned to the Uniform Crime Reports (UCR) for information on alcohol-related crimes. Burton found no statistically significant effect from the bans on whether people remained smokers or on violent crime. However, she did find that for those who drink, the bans increased how much they drank and that in high-prevalence smoking areas, there was a 4 percent increase in fatal drunk-driving crashes but only among high-prevalence smokers. Among all subjects, there was no increase in accidents. This means in the other subgroups, there were slight decreases or no effect on drunk driving. However, Burton told me the 4 percent finding among high-prevalence smokers was the only statistically significant finding. Burton inferred that the 4 percent observed increase in drinking was likely happening at bars and restaurants because there was no effect or a slight decline in alcohol purchased for home consumption. She said she isn\u2019t very concerned about the increase in drinking observed in her study \u2014 it amounts to about one drink a month, and there was no evidence that people were all of a sudden binge drinking or engaging in especially dangerous drinking behavior. But there are concerns with the drunk driving findings, which other researchers have pointed out. Before I get into the arguments against Adams, Cotti, and Burton\u2019s findings, I want to make something clear: At the end of the day, the documented health benefits to smoking bans like reductions in secondhand smoke exposure largely outweigh any of the costs, like a small increase in drunk driving in some places. Additionally, there are simple ways to eliminate potential increases in drunk driving. Following the release of Adams and Cotti\u2019s research (which originally showed an association between smoking bans and fatal drunk driving accidents), several researchers dove into the question in order to test their findings.  examined the effect of New York\u2019s and California\u2019s statewide bar and restaurant smoking bans on \u201calcohol-related car crash fatalities\u201d and found no association. They tested Adams and Cotti\u2019s hypothesis about jurisdiction shopping by looking at communities along the Pennsylvania-New York border but found no effect on drunk driving accidents.Andrew Hyland, chair of the department of health behavior at Roswell Park Comprehensive Cancer Center who was one of the authors of the 2013 paper, told me that the biggest concern his team had with Adams and Cotti\u2019s findings was that their research did not include counties where they found zero drunk driving fatalities, which could have biased their observed effect upward. \u201cZero events is a very important piece of information,\u201d Hyland told me.  Importantly, Hyland\u2019s research only looked at statewide bans. That means it doesn\u2019t rule out the most plausible jurisdiction-shopping story: one where a city has banned smoking but the state has not, so it\u2019s easy to find a bar just a few miles away that lets people indulge in both vices. As statewide smoking bans have proliferated over the years, this jurisdiction-shopping effect is becoming less plausible, highlighting an easy way to eliminate this concern \u2014 passing statewide bans everywhere. Looking to Burton\u2019s research, concerns with her findings can be boiled down to measurement error and whether she was actually able to isolate the effect of smoking bans. Self-reported measures of alcohol and cigarette consumption can be unreliable. First, because of something called \u201csocial desirability bias,\u201d people will often say what reflects better on them rather than the truth. In this case, smokers ashamed of the habit might report fewer cigarettes smoked than is true; heavy drinkers could do the same with their alcohol intake. Second, there\u2019s the issue of \u201crecall bias\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s actually just really hard to remember exact numbers when it comes to things like this. \u201cIf you add up all the alcohol that Americans say that they drink, you come to the conclusion that roughly half of all alcohol is poured down the drain, because nobody claims it. ... That means people aren\u2019t very good at reporting their drinking,\u201d Humphreys told me. For tobacco use, researchers have been able to corroborate survey data with biomarkers (which can\u2019t lie to pollsters). But for alcohol, this type of analysis isn\u2019t possible.\u201cShe\u2019s trying to do the best that she can with the data that she has available,\u201d Hyland said of Burton\u2019s research. \u201cThe question is, is that sufficient to make a statement that smoke-free policies are causing a 4 percent increase in [drunk driving] fatalities.\u201dBurton defends her use of survey data here by saying that even though there could be errors in self-reporting, those errors are likely uncorrelated with the implementation of a smoking ban. She believes the implementation of a smoking ban shouldn\u2019t affect how people respond to survey questions about their alcohol consumption and thus the change between those two points in time should still show the effect of smoke-free policies.Measurement error could also exist in Burton\u2019s reliance on data from the BRFSS and Nielsen. These sources provide data at the individual and household level, respectively. In order to compare county-by-county numbers, Burton used provided \u201cweights\u201d to extrapolate the given information. But the problem is, neither of these data sets is designed to be representative at the county level. So her county-by-county data could be fuzzy.As with most research, the biggest problem is trying to isolate the cause of the effect being studied. Aren\u2019t jurisdictions that implement smoking bans likely to have implemented other public health measures around the same time? Burton controls for a few of these, like state blood alcohol concentration limits for driving under the influence and whether the state has a cigarette tax, but says in the future she hopes to go further and include workplace smoking bans and other anti-smoking measures that could be driving the results she finds here.Notably, Burton did not control for the cost of alcohol or taxes on alcohol in her results. This is troubling since these have a well-documented effects on demand and could be confounding her results. \u201cI don\u2019t think that small increases in alcohol consumption by themselves are a bad thing,\u201d Burton told me. \u201cThe biggest concern is trying to compare the protective effects from secondhand smoke exposure, particularly for bar and restaurant workers ... against the cost of those potential increases in drunk driving fatalities.\u201dShe\u2019s right \u2014 and luckily, the small increase in drinking and the ambiguous effect on drunk driving she found are far outweighed by the benefits of smoke-free laws. \u201cSmoke-free policies in worksites and hospitality venues have been one of the greatest public health successes of the last 25 years,\u201d Hyland told Vox.While there is still some debate around the potential increase in drunk driving, there is a vast, peer-reviewed, scientific literature around the harms of secondhand smoke inhalation, and around the massive health benefits associated with the sharp decline in smoking in part due to smoke-free policies. We know that smoking bans have been  at . Bans in restaurants, bars, and other hospitality establishments have the added benefit of ensuring that workers are not forced to carry the health costs against their will simply due to their place of employment. Bans have also been effective at reducing  and Smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke increases the risk of cardiovascular disease, pulmonary disease, cancer, and death.  has shown that heart attack admissions \u201crapidly declined\u201d after the implementation of 100 percent smoke-free laws. All of this to say that if there was in fact a small increase in fatal drunk driving accidents as a result of these bans, the bans were still worth it. It can seem callous to think about policy in these terms, but it cannot be understated how much anti-smoking policies have improved health and general well-being. And that benefit far outweighs the potential that there could be some small increase in drunk driving fatalities. Especially since that risk could be curbed with other anti-drunk driving measures and by universalizing anti-smoking laws at bars, restaurants, and other hospitality establishments.\u201cReading this paper makes me more confident in the value of smoke-free laws,\u201d said Humphreys. \u201cBecause what it shows is there is no effect on violence, there is no effect on drunk driving ... and the claimed increases in drinking amount to a teaspoon of wine a day. So even if I believed that we could measure the alcohol consumption that accurately in big panel studies, which I don\u2019t, I don\u2019t care.\u201d\n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

I went looking for those stories, in hopes of understanding the events of this year from the ground level.What I found was remarkable. I talked to a woman who nursed an injured baby pig back to health. I talked to a sex worker who very quickly had to figure out how to make his business Covid-19-safe. I discussed opening up a marriage \u2014 at a time when nobody can see anybody in person \u2014 with someone who did just that.

{"article_title": ["One Good Thing: Try reading \u201cA Child\u2019s Christmas in Wales\u201d out loud"], "article_body": " Perhaps you are doing Christmas over Zoom this year. In that case, you will need to find some sort of festive holiday activity that every member of your party can participate in. Something you can do at a distance, which mostly rules out dinner and crafting and a lot of board games. Something that won\u2019t be affected by an audiolag, which rules out carol singing. May I suggest that you take turns reading out loud from Dylan Thomas\u2019s \u201c\u201d? Reading out loud is one of the great communal Zoom activities because there\u2019s a clear order to who\u2019s speaking when and you don\u2019t wind up in that awkward place where everyone is speaking over everyone else\u2019s audio lag. The downside is that under most circumstances, of course, reading out loud is insufferable as a group activity. But at Christmas, it\u2019s exactly the kind of pleasantly twee and old-fashioned pastime you might be craving.And \u201cA Child\u2019s Christmas in Wales\u201d is perfect for those purposes. It\u2019s the right length, barely 3,000 words long, the length of a mid-sized Vox explainer. It also sounds right. Thomas originally developed the piece for the radio, so it\u2019s designed to be read out loud, with the words encouraging you to chew them as you read. Give this sentence a try, describing postmen delivering Christmas packages: \u201cWith sprinkling eyes and wind-cherried noses, on spread, frozen feet they crunched up to the doors and mittened on them manfully.\u201d . Don\u2019t you just want to say that out loud a time or two? Can\u2019t you just see the postmen rapping bravely on those frozen doors?\u201cA Child\u2019s Christmas in Wales\u201d is a prose narrative, more or less: not quite a short story, not quite an essay, maybe a little bit a prose poem. It consists of reminiscences of Thomas\u2019s childhood Christmases, sometimes delivered directly to the reader and sometimes delivered in dialogue with an imagined child listener. In its 3,000 words, Thomas covers presents (both Useful and Useless), house fires, candy cigarettes, and the ubiquity of uncles at Christmas. What he is most concerned with, though, is evoking a sense memory of being a very small child at Christmas: the thrillingly cold snow, the itchy wool, the long stretches of boredom punctuated with vicious excitement. In this piece, \u201csnow [comes] shawling out of the ground and [swimming] and [drifting] out of the arms and hands and bodies of the trees,\u201d while boys wage war on cats, \u201csleek and long as jaguars and horrible-whiskered,\u201d and \u201call the Christmases roll down towards the two-tongued sea, like a cold and headlong moon bundling down the sky that was our street.\u201d When you read that sentence, or you hear it read to you, all your Christmases will come rolling down the street of your childhood home, too. And then it will be as if you are there, even this year, when maybe you cannot be. Reading \u201cA Child\u2019s Christmas in Wales\u201d is a way of gathering and escaping, all at the same time, in a year when we really need both. \n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

{"article_title": ["Hospital ICUs are filling up. It\u2019s even worse than it sounds."], "article_body": "As of mid-December, hospitals on average had just  across the country, and many were completely full. As the Covid-19 surge continues to intensify, lack of ICU beds can have dire consequences, including not being able to properly care for the sickestpatients, potentially  lifesaving care.But even these bed capacity numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story. Adding extra critical-care beds in other departments or buildings takes precious time, resources, and space. But adding trained staff is much more difficult, especially deep into a pandemic. When trained staff are in short supply, it\u2019s even harder for hospitals to best meet the needs of critical-care patients. These patients include people very sick with Covid-19, but also many who need to be in the ICU for , such as those who have had a heart attack or stroke, are recovering from major surgery, or are sick with the flu, among others. Only about  had more than 30 percent ICU capacity left on December 15, and coronavirus case numbers have only accelerated since then. And the reality on the ground in many areas is much worse, as  has shown. From the Times\u2019s data, gathered from the US Department of Health and Human Services, of about 100 hospitals in the Los Angeles area, more than 65 reported . Cedars-Sinai Medical Center had an occupancy at 112 percent of its capacity.In Dallas, the fourth-largest metropolitan area in the country, of the 47 hospitals with more than 20 Covid-19 patients, 80 percent of them had  left. The most open beds any hospital had was five. In the Minneapolis-St. Paul area, half of the hospitals with more than 20 Covid-19 patients . In Oklahoma, which has , of the hospitals with more than 20 Covid-19 cases, the majority were at more than 90 percent ICU bed occupancy. , a pulmonologist and critical-care physician at Integris health system in Oklahoma City, which reported full ICU occupancy in the  to the HHS, says they have turned regular patient rooms into ICU rooms to try to handle the rush of severely ill people. Even so, she said, \u201coccasionally Covid-19 patients must remain in the emergency department for several hours waiting for a bed to become available.\u201dAnd there is little sign of relief in many places around the country, with an average of  since early December. \u201cPatients keep coming, and we have to take care of them regardless of our staffing levels,\u201d Gisella Thomas, a respiratory therapist at Desert Regional Medical Center in Palm Springs, California, wrote to Vox in an email. \u201cI worry that there is only so long staff can hold up before breaking, which ultimately, in itself, could limit capacity\u201d further. The sickest Covid-19 patients can linger in the ICU for weeks \u2014 or longer. And although we have learned a lot since the spring about how to better treat severely ill Covid-19 patients, the disease itself is still challenging to address, and we don\u2019t have a cure for it. Which means the  of people who get Covid-19 and end up needing critical care are often in ICUs until either they are able to recover \u2014 which often includes invasive intubation treatment \u2014 or die. \n    Related\n  One of the reasons ICUs have been filling up is that once a patient with Covid-19 gets that sick, they are not likely to stabilize very quickly. A September study found that an average ICU stay for a Covid-19 patient was  \u2014 almost double the typical stay of . Other anecdotal reports show that many patients can be in the ICU for weeks or . And pinning down this number is crucial for projecting how many beds might be available in the future if cases continue to climb. As  pointed out, if an average length of stay in the ICU is 10 days, that means that every day there is only a 10 percent chance of a new bed opening up. So when admissions exceed that rate, ICUs are likely to get overwhelmed. This is something those working with critically ill coronavirus patients have to contend with every day. \u201cCovid-19 patients unfortunately stay in the ICU for a long time,\u201d Nagle said. \u201cThe course of the disease is very slow, and this contributes to the shortage of available beds.\u201dAnd while Covid patients are there, meeting their needs can be extremely labor-intensive. \u201cCovid-19 patients can be incredibly ill, with multiple machines to watch and adjust, multiple medications to give, and lab results to draw and results to watch,\u201d Nagle said. And although we now have a better understanding of possible treatments for seriously ill patients, \u201cpatients still respond in varying ways, and their progress and possible outcome is always unpredictable.\u201d This is another reason hospitals don\u2019t always have a good projection for how many ICU beds they might have in the coming weeks or days. Caring for Covid-19 patients also requires many more steps and precautions than when ICU staff work with other patients, further jamming units. All staff entering an ICU Covid-19 room must don full gowns and PPE each time, which is resource-intensive. \u201cThis also creates real difficulties if someone crashes because it slows down our response,\u201d Thomas said. \u201cThe need to more thoroughly clean all equipment also creates delays and makes normal staffing levels inadequate for the pandemic.\u201dIn the meantime, doctors, nurses, and other health care workers are struggling to provide the best care they can while being asked to handle more and more patients. \u201cCritically ill patients are very complex,\u201d said , a pulmonary critical-care physician at Baylor College of Medicine. \u201cThere are a lot of moving parts at the same time that require the same amount of priority.\u201d But, he said, \u201cwhen you are stretched out beyond capacity, you can\u2019t deliver the same quality care unless you create more skilled health care workers, and as we have found out, these are a scarce resource.\u201d Although hospitals can often somewhat expand the number of beds and amount of supplies, staff are in much shorter supply. \u201cThe most precious resource in any hospital are the human beings who are knowledgable and capable of caring for patients,\u201d Sarah Delgado, an acute care nurse practitioner and clinical practice specialist with the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses, wrote to Vox in an email. \u201cIt is the limiting factor.\u201d Without enough of these people to care for all of those who are very sick, \u201cpatient outcomes are likely to suffer,\u201d she said. \n    Related\n  And it is not just ICU physicians and nurses who are in short supply. \u201cCritical care is more of a team sport,\u201d Garner said. \u201cThis means physician-delivered care and interventions, but also careful medication selection dosage with pharmacists, skilled nursing care, respiratory therapists, midlevel providers, nutritionists, early mobilization with physical therapists.\u201d To that list, Nagle also adds all of the other hospital staff needed to perform other essential tasks in ICUs, including bathing patients, changing linens, and other functions. To accommodate surges of very ill Covid-19 patients, many hospitals have had to . At Christiana Hospital in Delaware, critical-care nurse Lauren Esposito and her colleagues typically work with critical cardiac patients. But this year, her unit has served as overflow for critical Covid-19 cases. \u201cAt first it was a little uneasy,\u201d  for the American Association of Critical-Care Nurses. Their hospital implemented a tiered staffing strategy in which cardiac nurses would work under trained ICU nurses. \u201cDuring the shift, if a patient was crashing, we were able to flex and have the ICU nurse go to that patient to provide care,\u201d she wrote. They were also able to provide quick training to nursing staff, for example, on working with intubated patients. Still, the overflow duties were straining, and they weren\u2019t made easier given the intensive isolation these patients are in to stop the spread of infection. \u201cI remember the first time I walked into a patient\u2019s room, it really hits you that you are the primary caregiver and no one else can come in.\u201d Also, staff now often have to attend to more patients at a time. In California, where last week an average of more than 44,600 people each day tested positive for the coronavirus, Gov. Gavin Newsom  from 1:2 to 1:3 in an effort to meet the surging numbers of Covid-19 hospitalizations. In Oklahoma, Nagle notes that although the ICU nurses she works with usually take care of one to two patients during a shift, \u201cwith the shortage of critical-care nurses, each nurse may have three, and under very extreme conditions, even four patients to care for.\u201d This increase in patients each nurse is seeing \u2014 especially in a complex illness like Covid-19 \u2014 is a major adjustment. \u201cNurses are at the patient\u2019s side every hour of every day, administering lifesaving medications, collaborating with other health care team members, translating information to families, and providing end-of-life presence when those families cannot visit due to strict isolation requirements,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cThis work cannot be done when the number of patients exceeds staffing capacity.\u201d And staff themselves often fall ill with the virus. According to a , as many as a quarter of Covid-19 infections in some states are among health care workers. Garner, whose  earlier this year, including his 4-month-old daughter, says getting the illness himself gave him a new perspective on the patients now flooding into local Texas ICUs. \u201cIt could have been me, my wife, or one of my kids on that ICU bed,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to rationalize the amount of sick patients by thinking, \u2018oh, well they weren\u2019t distancing,\u2019 or, \u2018they weren\u2019t wearing masks,\u2019 but the fact is that nobody deserves to catch this virus and get sick from it, not even the people who doubt it. As the spike continues to grow, compassion is the only thing that can keep us from becoming jaded and burned out. The flip side of that is remembering compassion for the health care workers caring for these patients, especially as the holidays approach. Not only will many of these workers continue long shifts through the holidays, they will do so knowing that many people are disregarding public health warnings to avoid gatherings. \u201cWe need the public to do its part,\u201d Delgado said. \u201cStop nonessential travel, adhere strictly to mask-wearing and social distancing guidelines, and limit gatherings with those outside your household,\u201d Delgado said.   \n    In April, Vox launched a way for readers to support our work with financial contributions \u2014 and we've been blown away by the response.

{"article_title": ["The Lost Year: Falling for your mailman in lockdown (but not getting the ending you wanted) "], "article_body": "When Alayna got in touch to tell me her story of a tumultuous 2020, she titled the email \u201cA Very COVID Christmas.\u201d And even though she\u2019s had a stressful, difficult year \u2014 one that involved opening a vintage clothing store just as quarantine began and losing a pet in the midst of the pandemic \u2014 a subject line that could have been the name of a Hallmark movie was apt.Alayna, stuck in the building that is both her store and her apartment for most of the year with mostly her bulldogs for company, developed a crush on her mailman. That crush was slowly but surely reciprocated, leading to the kind of slow-burn, in-person flirtation that seems increasingly like a throwback to an era before dating apps. As quarantine continued, the two got to know each other better \u2014 and then she found out his mail route was going to change in the new year.I\u2019ll let her tell you what happened next, but the image that has stuck with me since talking to Alayna is of her, in the early days of the pandemic, sitting in her shop, slowly cutting apart her merchandise to make masks for the people of her neighborhood. It seems to me a potent symbol of a time when nobody quite knew what to do, so we started making sacrifices to try to take care of and connect with each other.Here\u2019s the story of Alayna\u2019s 2020, as told to me.So I had a terrible divorce in Erie, Pennsylvania, about two years ago, and I decided to move home with my family in Pittsburgh and follow my dreams and open up my own vintage clothing store. I was gonna open my store in April, but that\u2019s right when our governor gave a lockdown order. I live in a little neighborhood right outside of the city, and nobody knew what was going on. Are we supposed to wear gloves? Are we supposed to take our shoes off? Nobody had masks. At that point, I was, like, \u201cWell, shit, I can\u2019t open my store. We might not make it through this.  might not make it through this!\u201d So I literally took my clothes, my merchandise, and started cutting it down into rectangles and making masks for the neighborhood. It was, like, \u201cForget it. If I don\u2019t ever get into business, at least I can help my neighbors.\u201d I was cutting up 1970s polyester and even this Oscar de la Renta suit. Like, \u201cUgggh, whatever!\u201d But everyone got their masks.It was basically just me and my bulldogs in the store. We really didn\u2019t see anyone. I had to stop construction on my renovation. Sometimes, my mom would stop by, and we\u2019d wave just off the porch. But! We always saw the mailman. Tried and true, he was there every day. There were actually other mailmen, but only one caught my eye. Essentially he was the only man that I saw for, like, six months. I\u2019d always appreciated how nice he was to my bulldogs. I had two bulldogs at the beginning of quarantine, but I lost one about a month ago. I cried more over losing him \u2014 his name was Meatball \u2014 than over any relationship with a human. I cried more for Meatball than in my divorce. I cried so much I had to go to the doctor because I got dry eye and had ruptured blood vessels and had to get eye drops. Thankfully, my other dog Louie is still here. He\u2019s doing better than I am. It\u2019s all a part of life, I guess.Anyway, the dogs like anybody, so they\u2019re not a very good tell. They would just wait for people to come up and say hi to them. I actually live above my boutique. I have an apartment upstairs in the building, and I would take the dogs downstairs to work. They\u2019d wait at the door for people to come visit. The mailman was so sweet to them. He would say hi to the dogs before me. That caught my eye.I forgot how to talk to people. I just lost all my game, any swag that I ever had. Remember a couple months back, people were like, \u201cWe\u2019re going to lose the post office!\u201d? So I asked him, \u201cHow\u2019s everything going? How can we help?\u201d And I accidentally told him that I loved him. It came out really weird. I was just like, \u201cOh, thanks for all you do, and the dogs and I love you!\u201d He was very nice and didn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cI love you guys, too.\u201d I tweeted, \u201cI just told the mailman I loved him on accident.\u201d It caused a little bit of a following. I started asking the other mail guys about him. Maybe the mailmen told him, \u201cOh, the new girl down at the clothing store might have the hots for you.\u201d So he started coming by. Our chats became a little bit longer. We\u2019re so used to dating apps and making a judgment call based on someone\u2019s age, what they look like, and their job. So this was like life before! It was like, \u201cOh, this must be like what they did during the Dust Bowl, when no one could go to see people.\u201d We\u2019re stranded, but we can always rely on the post office.It was nice out, and it was summer. I wasn\u2019t working, so I was on the porch a lot. He would park his van right beside my porch. We had all the time in the world. It was reasonable to take the time to get to know someone and ask each other questions. He was just a giant teddy bear. He was all bearded with long, flowy hair. He was so the opposite of what I would typically go for. I\u2019m usually a sucker for a guy in a suit, clean-shaven. It was my first real ...  with a true yinzer in the time I\u2019ve lived in Pittsburgh. It was fun, too. When was the last time in 2020 that I was able to be excited about something? One day, before we had really become friends, I saw him walk past my door, and I was like, \u201c[gasps] IT\u2019S THE MAILMAN!\u201d He told me a couple days ago that he was getting a new route as of January 1. I was very like, \u201cI\u2019m never gonna see him again.\u201d [The panic] was pretty intense! But then I thought, \u201cWait a minute. He\u2019s cute, but we\u2019re just a little too different.\u201d The conversation just wasn\u2019t free-flowing. At first I thought that I was very awkward in general and had forgotten how to flirt. Then I thought it was maybe nerves, where he didn\u2019t know what to ask me. I could talk to a wall. I could talk all day. By the time we got to know each other and the nerves had passed \u2014 it got to an exhausting point where I was doing all the talking and asking all the questions. And I\u2019m certainly not going to settle after all the shit that I\u2019ve been through. I told him it wasn\u2019t going to work out. It was too bad. It did feel a little like I was in a Hallmark movie. People on Twitter would send me cheesy Christmas Hallmark film titles [on Twitter].  or . It was so nice people could have a connection over something fun and nice. But I tweeted, \u201cTwitter friends, I am so, so sorry, but I have to cancel . Things just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d It didn\u2019t even last until Christmas.But maybe I\u2019ll get a spinoff.

{"article_title": ["Food banks have had a record year. Here\u2019s what it\u2019s like to run one."], "article_body": "Years ago, when Derrick Chubbs was working at the Red Cross, his team held a seminar simulating a potential pandemic. Chubbs, now the president of the Central Texas Food Bank, recalled that training earlier this year as he stared down a potential world-altering crisis. Before the rest of us were taking the  seriously, he stockpiled food, implemented safety measures, and scouted auxiliary storage facilities. But like so many other organizations pushing through the Covid-19 era, Chubbs quickly understood that there was no way to fully prepare for a pandemic. He and his team needed to roll with the punches \u2014 that\u2019s the only way a nonprofit can sufficiently cover the economic carnage the coronavirus is leaving in its wake.Speaking as 2020 winds to a close, Chubbs tells me that, this year, the Central Texas Food Bank has smashed all of its previous records. Covid-19 has debilitated the American job market and has left an unprecedented wave of food insecurity. Thanksgiving was marked by . The Washington Post reported that . The National Geographic speculated  as the pandemic persists. Even as vaccines mobilize, it\u2019s clear that this emergency isn\u2019t going to go away. Unsurprisingly, the Central Texas Food Bank is distributing more food to more people than ever before, and tallying up a much larger bill in the process.All of this keeps Chubbs awake at night. He\u2019s confident that the Central Texas Food Bank can continue to meet the demand through the next few months. But if his worst fears come true and people are still impoverished and hungry by 2023, Chubbs isn\u2019t sure if his infrastructure will hold up. We talked about that, as well as how his staff socially distances while dropping off meals, and his long, strange journey from Dell and IBM to the nonprofit sphere.  At a certain point, I felt that I needed to feel more relevance in what I was doing. I have no complaints about my experiences with IBM, Pervasive, or Dell. They were all unique, I got paid, no complaints. But in all honesty, I needed more. I started feeling it long before I left, and I\u2019ve been fortunate enough to have some good mentors along the way. Eventually, the stars aligned and I got a call about the Red Cross, and I never thought they\u2019d hire me. I thought they\u2019d think that I was going to try to turn the organization into Dell, but they did, and that\u2019s how I got my start in the field.If I could do it differently, I wouldn\u2019t. I\u2019d do it exactly the same way. Even though I didn\u2019t plan this journey at all.I remember going back to some Red Cross simulations that I had. One of them happened to be simulating a pandemic, and that was the scariest class I had ever gone to. In February, I didn\u2019t expect Covid to be as dramatic in America as it ended up being, but I remember bringing the team together and saying, \u201cLet\u2019s have a what-if discussion. What if this thing blows out of proportion?\u201d The more we talked about it, the more we became afraid. My first thought was, \u201cWhat if this thing lingers? What areas might be impacted?\u201d First and foremost was minimizing risk for the team \u2014 both staff and volunteers. What do we need to do in the building to protect them? We interact with hundreds of clients on a daily basis.Eighty percent of our food is distributed through 250 partner agencies across the counties that we serve. It wasn\u2019t just us. We\u2019re talking food pantries, church pantries \u2014 some very small, some large \u2014 and they depend heavily on volunteers to run those operations. And the majority of those volunteers were in the high-risk group. It was a totally different dynamic we had to deal with. How do we scale ourselves and help our partners scale at the same time? We hadn\u2019t even started talking about issues procuring food. We had to change our entire model. We can\u2019t do client-choice anymore. Now we distribute through boxes of food. That\u2019s what you see on television: these lines and lines of cars, with food banks loading food directly into them. The number of people that could congregate in one area was also drastically reduced, which means that we dropped the number of volunteers we could bring into the building by 70 percent. Normally, we could handle 100 volunteers per shift. That went down to 30. At the same time, demand was skyrocketing. We were fortunate because we had food. I started buying a lot of food at the beginning. We weren\u2019t one of those banks that was strapped for cash and couldn\u2019t accumulate a stockpile. I even started looking for additional places to store food in the event that I couldn\u2019t store it all in my building. So in our first 90 days, I didn\u2019t have a major supply challenge. What I had was a human resource problem, and not having as many people as I needed. We went to five of our largest churches that had major operations, and we could pull trucks up into their parking lots and unload pallets of food so they could build boxes for us. That\u2019s how we got through July: us and our churches building those boxes. If it hadn\u2019t been for that, we wouldn\u2019t have been able to meet the demand.Ordinarily, we would distribute 3.7 million to 4 million pounds of food a month. We are now in the 7 million range. The pandemic has left so many people out of work. In the mid-to-late summer, we saw people coming to us for the first time. We track that stat. It was a 200 percent increase of newcomers. Our target was 50 million pounds last year. This year, we\u2019ve done 64.5 million. Ordinarily, we\u2019d distribute food to about 50,000 people a week. Last month, we distributed food to 343,000. I fully expect December to be higher than November. Only at the beginning. We realized the amount of money we were spending to purchase food increased exponentially. Ordinarily, we would spend about $100,000 a month on food. Over the last several months in a row, we were over a million. That scares me because it\u2019s unsustainable. We can\u2019t continue to do that. I\u2019m living off the extreme generosity of this community, but that won\u2019t last forever. We had a consulting group come in pro bono, and one of the things they were saying is that we will see elevated levels throughout 2021, well into 2022, and as a worst-case scenario, into 2023. We are at the beginning of this. The number of people coming to us just keeps getting higher. We had a similar spike during the government shutdown during 2019, and the thing we kept hearing from out-of-work government employees was, \u201cThis will likely take me six months to recover from just being unemployed for six weeks.\u201d Can you imagine what\u2019s coming our way? We have people who\u2019ve been out of work for months, some of them for a year. The recovery is going to be extremely long term.I feel pretty good about it. I am blessed to be in one of the most supportive communities in this country. They\u2019ve always come to the rescue. I feel confident that we\u2019ll keep it up for the next 90 days. Ask me after those 90 days and it might be a different story. My concern is still hinged on the ability to procure enough food to meet these demands. And to be totally honest with you, even at the levels we\u2019re at now, we\u2019re still 25 percent short of meeting the complete demand. We\u2019re literally wrestling with what\u2019s in front of us. But we\u2019re doing everything we can to continue to distribute food and continue to advocate for the dignity and self-respect of the people that seek our services.

Many of them are excellent, and even the ones that aren\u2019t are still pretty fun, if you\u2019re in the right mood.

The men decide to embark on an experiment, reasoning that the human body is naturally 0.05 percent deficient in alcohol and that they can test whether maintaining a low buzz all day will enable them to live a better life. Obviously, things escalate from there.This sounds like a sophomoric and possibly horrible premise for a film, but instead director Thomas Vinterberg has made a truly wonderful movie about trying to come to grips with life, anchored by terrific performances from Mads Mikkelsen, Thomas Bo Larsen, Magnus Millang, and Lars Ranthe.

Two old friends (Wiest and Bergen) accompany Hughes, along with her nephew (Hedges). And an editor from Hughes\u2019s publisher (Gemma Chan) tags along too, desperate to see Hughes\u2019s latest manuscript.

This backing mirrors support for mask usage overall, with 72 percent of people polled agreeing that masks should be required in all public places and 66 percent saying they should be required to be worn around anyone outside of the household. Both statements garnered support from the majority of people in both parties, though a smaller proportion of Republicans agreed with them. Biden\u2019s mask mandate would apply to federal public locations such as post offices, courthouses, and trains, while states would be able to impose their own rules elsewhere. The mandate follows , which encourages people to wear face masks in order to reduce the spread of droplets that can transmit the coronavirus when people speak, cough, and sneeze. As part of , Biden has also said he\u2019s focused on making sure most schools have the resources needed to reopen safely within his first 100 days. And currently, there is a slight split on when people think schools should reopen: 27 percent of poll respondents think they should be open now; 35 percent think they should open when they have the funding needed to implement protections and do it safely; and 32 percent think they should open when the vaccine is widely distributed. Other coronavirus policies that received solid support in the poll include free access to the vaccine (85 percent), free coronavirus testing (78 percent), access to self-administered coronavirus testing at home (65 percent), increased mobile testing options and drive-through sites (81 percent), and the implementation of a one-month lockdown to slow the spread of coronavirus (52 percent).Timing around the adoption of a vaccine was another area that was somewhat mixed: 38 percent of people said they\u2019d take it as soon as they could; 16 percent said they\u2019d do it after a few people they knew already had; 27 percent said they\u2019d take it after a lot of people had; and 19 percent said they\u2019d never take it. A much higher proportion of Republicans (31 percent) and independents (19 percent) said they would never take it, compared to Democrats (8 percent).The poll was conducted from December 19 to 21 with 1,104 likely voters, and has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points.

Trump still has to sign the stimulus bill for it to become law, and he\u2019s rapidly running out of time to do so: Because the stimulus is attached to a broader funding package, the government could shut down if Trump doesn\u2019t sign it by December 28.Given his opposition to the legislation, Trump could potentially veto the bill directly or use what\u2019s known as a pocket veto, in which any bill he doesn\u2019t sign before Congress adjourns on January 3, 2021, is effectively vetoed.
